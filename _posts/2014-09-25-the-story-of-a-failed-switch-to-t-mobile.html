<ul>
<li>Got the iPhone 6 (cue laughing from Android evangelists)</li>
<li>Had no frigging clue what to do.</li>
<li>Tried to call myself</li>
<li>Call 1
<ul>
<li>Put on to sales line - didn't mind holding. I wasn't the only one who'd ordered a phone and it didn't take too long in the grand scheme of things</li>
<li>Asked to transfer number</li>
<li>Apparently should have asked to activate service</li>
<li>Second guy was pleasant, would talk your ear off</li>
<li>Asked if I wanted pre-pay or post-pay. I didn't know, so asked for post pay.</li>
<li>Credit check</li>
<li>Then the kicker. Ship the new sim.</li>
<li>Apparently the sim I had was pre-pay only. Would have been useful to know this.</li>
<li>Last thing before hanging, up, confirmed the address, since he got my credit card number wrong. Glad I did.</li>
<li>Got one number in each line of the address wrong</li>
<li>Couldn't change it, get tracking number on Monday and change with UPS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checked online - billing address wrong too</li>
<li>Call 2
<ul>
<li>Got through in 5 minutes, not bad</li>
<li>"Hi, I've got a SIM ordered and the address was taken down wrong, so I had to be"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
