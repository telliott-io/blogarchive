<p>This afternoon, I was walking past a construction site and did a double take. Part of me could swear I'd just walked past a mirror, but hadn't seen myself in the reflection. After a brief moment of vampire-based self doubt, I stepped back a few paces and saw this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/assets/IMG_0001.jpg" width="590" height="442" /><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was just a hole in the hoarding, surrounded by a moderately tasteful frame. Contrast this with another hole about 10 feet further along:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/assets/IMG_0002.jpg" width="737" height="553" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's strange how something as simple as a wooden frame in a particular style can so change our perception of things. In my head, those sorts of frames were always around mirrors (particularly mirrors above mantlepieces at my parents' house), so what I was seeing through it <strong>must</strong> have been a reflection. Even though half a second of thought dispels the illusion completely - the lack of my own reflection aside, a row of apartment buildings were opposite the frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The shelf with holes for tealights suggests to me this is a memorial of some kind. Or perhaps it's just a piece of disruptive art. Or students dicking around (NYU is everywhere around here). I'd love to know how it got there. If anyone has any ideas, let me know!</p>
