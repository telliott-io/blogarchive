<p><strong><img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="179" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/tv.jpg" />Back in November, a crew from Sky came along to 5 Minutes of Fame to film some of the night for a documentary. Surprisingly enough, I got asked back in January to take part in the remainder of the segment. And the episode in question is airing next Monday!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The show is called <em>How to Get What You Want</em> and is an 8-part series on how to use social science, body language, and other techniques to, appropriately enough, get what you want.</p>
<p>Monday's episode is part 5 of 8, and is on the subject of humour. In keeping with the theme of handy life tips, I was lucky enough to be given some coaching for my stand-up act from Anjula Mutanda, a life coach and psychologist, and Logan&nbsp;Murray, a comedy tutor. Not only that, but I then got to try out what I'd learned in front of a pre-warmed audience at the Comedy Store! It was probably the warmest audience I've performed to, not least because they were warmed up by the fantastic Andi Osho and Chris James, but possibly helped along a little by the promise of free drinks if they laughed loudly enough.</p>
<p>I've not seen the final show yet, but I'm trying to blag a copy of the full recordings of my &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; spots, so hopefully I can do a proper gig report sometime after the episode airs.</p>
<p>Episode 5 is on next Monday (<strong>March 15th</strong>) at <strong>8pm</strong> on <strong>Sky One</strong>. If you've been to 5 Minutes of Fame, there might be a good few familiar faces. If you do, let me know, I&nbsp;haven't got Sky.</p>
