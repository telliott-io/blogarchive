<p><strong>Its been a while since my <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/69">last resolution update</a>, but I've finally got my act together and ticked off another one:&nbsp;&quot;Visit at least two countries, and write a review of the local breakfast foods&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>After being given a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; ultimatum on my remaining holiday allowance for the year, I decided to take a week and do some sightseeing. I&nbsp;booked a few days in Paris and a few in Berlin, so I&nbsp;could visit all the tourist spots I'd heard about but never got around to visiting, as well as sample the morning offerings in the hotels.</p>
<p>So, first stop: <strong>France</strong> for <em>petit d&eacute;jeuner</em>.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img align="middle" width="500" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="375" src="/assets/frenchbreakfast(1).jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="rteleft">The hotel buffet consisted mainly of pastries and other baked goods, which was enticing, but I couldn't find the balance between taking too little to set me up for the day, and taking so much that I looked like a glutton. The variety was nice though, even if everything was extremely sweet, leaving me expecting a severe sugar crash around about 11am.</p>
<p class="rteleft">As a deviation from the baked treats, I&nbsp;also picked up a pot of what I&nbsp;assumed was some kind of fruit slices or similar. It turned out to be an apple puree that was halfway between a pork accompaniment and baby food. I wasn't entirely sure what to do with it, so spread a little on some bread. If anyone can explain what it actually was (and how it was intended to be eaten), I'm keen to find out.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The coffee was ok, but I was confused by the lack of cream, whitener or even a small jug one could decant cereal milk into. Not wanting to appear drastically uncouth by pouring directly from the large jugs at the buffet, I&nbsp;resigned myself to black coffee. Which actually helped offset the sweetness of the food.</p>
<p class="rteleft">So final verdict, enjoyable - if mildly confusing - but not something I'd have every day.</p>
<p class="rteleft">A couple of days later, I&nbsp;headed to <strong>Germany</strong> for <em>Fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck</em>.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img align="middle" width="500" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="375" src="/assets/germanbreakfast.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p class="rteleft">Now the buffet at the hotel in Berlin were far more savoury, with a selection of cold meats, sausage, eggs, and an interesting potato dish. I&nbsp;believe pastries and such were also available, but I'd had my fill of those in Paris.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Selecting what I&nbsp;now realise was the closest I&nbsp;could approximate an English breakfast, my biggest surprise probably came in the scrambled eggs. I'm not normally a fan of this particular form of egg preparation, but these had a heck of a lot more flavour than I expected. Whether this was due to the eggs themselves or some extra ingredient I'm not sure (mustard has been suggested as an explaination), but they were very tasty nontheless.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The potatoes were also very enjoyable, served with bacon lardons and grated onion: possibly something I'll have to try making myself at some point.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Meat wise, I selected a few slices of ham and some sliced sausage (two varieties were served together). The cold meats on offer seemed a bit like a deli counter (including salami and other sandwichy meats), but was surprisingly tasty first thing in the day.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I did cheat a little and had the &quot;English Breakfast&quot; tea, but heck, my resolution specified <em>foods</em>, so there was nothing wrong with alternative beverages.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I'd probably vote for the German breakfast over the French, mainly as it was a tad closer to what I'd call a &quot;proper&quot; full breakfast, and because I didn't actually feel hungry again until late in the evening, which meant I&nbsp;didn't have to stop my sightseeing tour for lunch, etc.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Another resolution down. Only a few left now, but also only a few weeks left of the year!&nbsp;Better get a move on.</p>
<p class="rteleft">And speaking of sightseeing, I took a heck of a lot of pictures and video during my trip, which I'll be putting online bit by bit over the next few days. So stay tuned!</p>
