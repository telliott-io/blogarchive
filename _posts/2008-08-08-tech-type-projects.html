<p>First and foremost, I'm a computer geek. So here's a little bit about some of the projects I've worked on, past and present.<br /><strong><br /></strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vijava"><strong>VI&nbsp;Java API</strong></a></p>
<p>An open-source Java wrapper for the VMware Virtual Infrastructure Web Services API. It provides a simplified model for managing resources in VI, with a more OO-esque framework than currently exists. It was written primarily by Steve&nbsp;Jin at VMware, and after approval for open-source release, I joined the team to provide a few sample classes. Still ongoing, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=90078"><strong>properJavaRDP</strong></a></p>
<p>An open-source project I worked on during an internship at Propero in 2005, properJavaRDP&nbsp;is a Java-based RDP&nbsp;client. Started in 2003 by Phil Carmalt, it is essentially a Java port of rdesktop. I took on the work to update the client to support RDP 5, 15, 16 and 24-bit colour, as well as improving clipboard and keyboard support. Since I finished my time on it, several of the forum contributors have taken it up and provided patches for audio support and bugfixes.</p>
<p><strong>Coming Soon<br /></strong></p>
<p>Once I&nbsp;get my act together, I'll get some of my <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> modules up here. Including the social network status block I'm using on this site, as well as a user location map, image uploader and other handly little bits.</p>
