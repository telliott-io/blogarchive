<p>As the year is drawing to a close, a lot of people have been posting generated images featuring selected examples of their 2010 Facebook updates. I tried doing this, but the updates that were selected turned out to be incredibly boring, mostly involving complaints about London Underground.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&nbsp;discovered a thing called <a href="http://pummelvision.com/">PummelVision</a>, a funky little tool that will take all your photos from a web account (Facebook, Flickr, etc) and compile them into a short movie. All I had to do was authenticate my Facebook and YouTube accounts and a few hours later - during which I went out for a pint - an e-mail appeared telling me my video was ready.</p>
<p>And here it is, the last few years of my life, condensed in to 3 minutes of still frames.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><object width="560" height="340"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/y_ohZ0V0M5s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><embed width="560" height="340" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/y_ohZ0V0M5s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1"></embed></object></p>
<p>Christ, I've been to a lot of weddings.</p>
<p>Why not give it a go?&nbsp;You might be surprised to see&nbsp;how much fun you've been having lately!</p>
