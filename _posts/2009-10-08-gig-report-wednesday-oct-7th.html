This Wednesday's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=47340762620">5 Minutes of Fame</a> was fantastic fun, with an audience full of characters - some of whom weren't even acts.</strong></p>
<p>Brad Zimmerman had graciously agreed to MC this week, so I got the chance to do a normal spot for the first time in a few weeks. So I figured I'd take the opportunity to tighten up some of my existing material, and cut out some unnecessary waffle. This would shave some time off that I could use to play around with the audience a little, exercising some of what I'd been practicing during my compering gigs.</p>
<p>I'd been noticing that some of the more surreal or &quot;performance&quot; based routines would be received differently by different audiences. So I tried to throw in a few additional gags to top and tail them, and it worked pretty well. The additions to the Pirate routine went down great, and injected some much needed humour into a long set up.</p>
<p>I kinda lost it a little in the middle, and some of the energy I had at the start dropped. It became apparent to me that I was focusing on one side of the room too much, and when I started to extend into the neglected areas, things started to pick up a little, so I at least managed to go out with some decent laughs.</p>
<p>I felt much more relaxed on stage than I had in a long time, and free enough to inject some banter with the front row - it was certainly easier to pick out someone who'd already been talked to by previous acts. It was even easier with the members of the audience who had nicknames, a device Brad set up and I will certainly have to toy with the next time I'm MCing, as it gave a great sense of continuity to the night when acts could easily make references to prior goings-on.</p>
<p>So, all in all, a great night, and plenty of thoughts to take away.</p>
