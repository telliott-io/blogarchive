<p><strong><img width="131" height="150" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/halftone-microphone.jpg" />Last night was the first edition of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=274792775645">The Other Open Mic</a>, a new, hopefully monthly comedy night I'm running at <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/the-lounge-info-59738.html">The Lounge</a> in the City. So I had another chance to flex my fledgling MC muscles&hellip;along with some more mixed metaphors</strong>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone that came along to perform and to watch, had some really nice comments about the night as a whole, and hope everyone had as much fun as I did!</p>
<p>I took Dale's advice, and tried to interact with the audience a little bit more, which certainly took some getting used to, but I got the feeling that the crowd are fare more forgiving when you're talking with them rather than at them. It also seemed to get a little easier as the night went on, which I'd like to think was a sign of my ability developing&hellip;but probably also had a little to do with the drink.</p>
<p>A few things I can probably take away from this gig:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more I chat with the audience, the easier it will get</li>
<li>My stage persona doesn't suit being mean to people</li>
<li>Unless they deserve it</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're already booked in for the next instalment, on Monday October 26th, once again at the Lounge. Keep checking the Facebook group for more info!</p>
<p>So roll on tomorrow, when I'll be giving compering another crack at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=170518283078">5 Minutes of Fame</a>. Practise makes&hellip;not&hellip;rubbish.</p>
