<p><strong><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7921858.stm">Alcohol on TV 'prompts drinking'</a></strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;People are more likely to turn to alcohol while watching TV if they see drinking being portrayed in films or adverts, a study suggests.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Now, forgive me for being naive here, but seeing something in an advert and wanting it?&nbsp;Doesn't that mean the advert has...you know...<strong>succeeded</strong>?</p>
<p>The research, which consisted of showing combinations of films and adverts to 80 students, was &quot;<em>led by a team from Radboud University in the Netherlands&quot;. </em>Which implies that it takes more than one team to organise a booze up and a movie night, not only that, but a sufficient number of teams are required that a separate team has to be appointed to supervise them.</p>
<p>I'm suddently regretting my decision to leave academia. Free beer is much more fun than being able to afford it.</p>
