<p><div class="alignright panel panel-default"><div class="panel-body text-center"><a href="/blogarchive/assets/photo.png"><img class=" wp-image-960  " alt="&quot;log in with facebook&quot; - possibly not yours" src="/blogarchive/assets/photo.png" width="307" height="461" /></a></div><div class="panel-footer text-center">Let's log in with Facebook. We won't tell you who's.</div></div></p>
<p><strong>More and more websites and services are making use of Facebook to save users the chore of creating a new account. A great time-saver, maybe, but with convenience comes a greater chance to cock things up royally.</strong></p>
<p>"Hey, can I use your laptop to check my Facebook?" Surprisingly dangerous words. Not just because your friend might post suggestive messages on your feed.</p>
<p>Friend still logged in on my phone, redeemed a LivingSocial voucher. Saw her name come up.</p>
<p>Would be possible to try a number of well known sites to access their accounts.</p>
<p>Shopping sites would be susceptible.</p>
<p>Could mess with their social life.</p>
<p>Destroy their farms.</p>
<p>This makes Facebook the weak link. They recently moved to all https to prevent easy theft of login tokens from Wi-Fi.</p>
