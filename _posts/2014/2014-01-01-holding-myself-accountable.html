<p><strong>Happy New Year! 2013 has come and gone, a year described by a number of my Facebook friends as "crap". Welcome to 2014, a year in which I seriously need to get back to writing.</strong></p>
<p>Suffice to say, last year had its ups and downs. I've made new friends, visited new places, and embarked upon probably the most stable relationship I've ever had (more on that later). All whilst totally failing to get any exercise, or to write anything in this blog. Guess I've been working too hard. That's <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/925">startups for you</a>.</p>
<p>I've had ideas, but not acted on them. I've started writing some notes, but never finished. And frankly, I'm getting somewhat annoyed with myself. Until now, there's been no penalty for not writing other than a vague sense that I'm not doing something I want to do. I need to hold myself accountable.<!--more--></p>
<div>So for 2014, I have just one resolution (not quite going back to the weighty planning of 2009-2011). This year, I will write something on this blog every week. Any content, any topic, just write something. The only requirement is that I write at least 250 words.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Should I fail to do this on any given week, my penance shall be to post a picture of myself with a bulldog clip attached to my face. If this continues for consecutive weeks, I will add a clip for each week.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A video would also be acceptable. By which I mean a video counts as content. Videos of bulldog torture are optional.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm going to count this as my writing for week 1 of the year (274 words, boom!). Wish me luck! And have a great year, everyone.</div>
