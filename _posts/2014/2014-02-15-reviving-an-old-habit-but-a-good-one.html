<p>I admit, I expected to get a little further with my blogging goal before missing a week, let alone two. Or three. I've kind of lost count. Suffice to say I've had a hard February so far. I won't go into details, but I'm coming out of the other side feeling better than I have in a long while, and I'm eager to crack on with some self improvement. First stop, finally joining a gym in NYC.</p>
<p><!--more-->I've been in the city for nearly 17 months, and in that time I've tried a whole bunch of different exercise regimens. Running in East River Park was all well and good until it got too cold to wear shorts, then it was too hot to be outside (apparently Britain lacks any kind of real seasons). The XBox and Kinect combo was fun, but took just long enough to sign in and load that it seemed like a chore. The <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/">7 minute workout</a> was amazing, but so painful that I knew that the next session would only be worse with every day I procrastinated, so I procrastinated indefinitely. And the less said about <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do">Insanity</a>, the better.</p>
<p>Despite having tried all manner of alternatives to the gym, in all honesty, I've missed it. But I was spoiled in London, I had a <a href="http://www.thebanksidehealthclub.co.uk/">great gym</a> in the basement of the building where I worked, and could sneak off for a session in the middle of the afternoon, then come back refreshed for a couple of hours of super productiveness. The <a href="http://www.spotflux.com/">Spotflux</a> office isn't so well served, and the hipster ethos in Williamsburg apparently includes weird boutique gyms that push complex and demanding workout classes in lieu of having showers available. And I just didn't trust myself to have the willpower to go to a Manhattan gym either side of work. Couple that with the general expectation of gyms being pricey, I've done everything I could to avoid the issue.</p>
<p>This week, however, the lack of exercise and missing the "fourth place" in my life, I joined up at my local <a href="http://nyhrc.com/">New York Health and Racquet Club</a>. They have a location handily close to Union Square, so I can get the subway a couple of extra stops after work, then walk home, possibly via some sort of food outlet. After all, I was only going to spend the time vegging on the couch anyway.</p>
<p>I finished up work around 7.30 today and headed straight to the gym for my first session. I dove into my old favourites: treadmill and elliptical, and realized two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My fitness has gone down a long way</li>
<li>Setting a treadmill to metric makes it seem like you're doing better</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite not quite being at my best, I felt like having a constant view of my performance and being forced into a pace kept me honest, and it was far easier to push myself than when road running. And having mirrors all around was a bit of a motivator. So I think the gym is the place for me. And this gym actually has showers! With free shower gel! And towels! And the towels are just a little to small to fit around my waist! So more motivation!</p>
<p>In case you can't tell, I'm a little excited. Or high on endorphins. One of those. Roll on my next session!</p>
<p>PS: Yes, I'm aware I owe the internet a bulldog clip picture for the last few weeks. It's coming as soon as I go to Staples.</p>
