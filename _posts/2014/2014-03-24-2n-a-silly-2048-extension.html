<p>Last week, I got hooked on <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> after playing the <a href="http://games.usvsth3m.com/2048-doctor-who-edition/">Doctor Who Edition</a> obsessively on my lunch break.</p>
<p>Unnecessarily excited with the powers-of-twoness of the game, I <a href="https://github.com/theothertomelliott/2-to-the-n">forked the code</a> and let you play a <a href="http://theothertomelliott.github.io/2-to-the-n/">slightly bigger version</a> (or two).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theothertomelliott.github.io/2-to-the-n/"><img class="wp-image-1063 aligncenter" alt="2^n Screenshot" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-03-23-at-22.37.03.png" width="548" height="509" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I call it <em>2^n</em>. Because <em>2048/4096/8192</em> was too hard to read. It doesn't necessarily make the game any more fun, but if you were wondering about what it would be like bigger, now you can find out!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From a technical standpoint it was a quick and fun little challenge. I don't often get chance to muck around with proper interactive web stuff (or should that be "tend to avoid"?), and this introduced me to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, a lovely little tool for generating complicated CSS files.</p>
