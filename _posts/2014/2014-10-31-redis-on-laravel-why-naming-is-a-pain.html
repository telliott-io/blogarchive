<p><a href="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-10-30-at-22.44.50.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1113" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-10-30-at-22.44.50.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-30 at 22.44.50" width="300" height="148" /></a>It's Thursday night, and you're looking to start using Redis in your Laravel application. You fire up your <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead">Homestead</a> box (more on this in another post), open your favourite IDE and put in a new route to start playing around. Just something simple to start, write then read a value, just like the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/redis#usage">example</a>.</p>
<p>You save, and load up the route in your browser, only to see:</p>
<pre>Call to undefined method Redis::connection()</pre>
<p>That can't be right, can it? The Redis class is built-in to Laravel, and connection() was in the example. How can it be missing?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>As it turns out, <em>Redis</em> is a popular name for Redis classes, so <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/1066">there may be a conflict</a> between Laravel's Redis alias and another Redis class. In my case (and most likely), the Redis PHP extension provided by the <em>php-redis</em> package. Are you sick of me saying Redis yet?</p>
<p>The solution is nice and simple, you just need to edit your app config, open <em>app/config/app.php</em> and replace this line:</p>
<pre>'Redis' => 'Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis',</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre>'LaravelRedis' => 'Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis',</pre>
<p>Then you can get your Redis instance like this:</p>
<pre>$redis = LaravelRedis::connection();</pre>
<p>Quick and straightforward to solve, after an absolute nightmare to diagnose.</p>
<p>Important lesson learned today: it's probably not a good idea to use someone else's product name as your class name, especially if that class isn't distinguished by a package.</p>
<h2>Caveat - third party Composer packages</h2>
<p>There is probably a good reason that Laravel is still using 'Redis' as the default Redis alias - Composer packages. If you use a third party package that makes use of Redis with the default, you're screwed. In which case, you may want to remove the PHP Redis package entirely.</p>
<p>For example, on Ubuntu:</p>
<pre class="p1">apt-get remove php5-redis</pre>
<p>Don't forget to restart your PHP service as required.</p>
