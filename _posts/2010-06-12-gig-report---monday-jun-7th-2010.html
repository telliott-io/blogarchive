<p><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="182" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/jesterjesters.jpg" /><strong>Last Monday, I was at Jester Jesters for five minutes of frenzied joke telling. This is fast becoming one of my favourite nights, </strong><strong>a great little space and always a friendly atmosphere.</strong></p>
<p>I brought out the new bits I'd debuted at William IV again, and, again, I'd completely failed to rehearse. As a result, I stumbled over a couple of my gags, which can't have looked good.&nbsp;Luckily, I still got something of a laugh, so if I can actually get my act together and practice them for next time, I might be on to a winner.</p>
<p>I've inserted a few more &quot;punny&quot; gags to this routine, just to see how they go. This set is lending itself well to swapping bits in and out, as it isn't too rigidly structured, being more a series of short gags and observations. A few things fell flat, but I'm getting the hang of reacting to duff reactions, with lines like &quot;my flatmate told me not to tell that one&quot;, which seem to go well with the persona I'm slowly creating.</p>
<p>All in all, a really fun night. Just need to rehearse more now.</p>
