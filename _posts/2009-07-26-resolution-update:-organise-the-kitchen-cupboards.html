<p><strong>I'm going to tick off another resolution, one that's been bothering me for a while. I finally got around to organising the kitchen cupboards. Quite frankly, they were overflowing and nothing had its own place, it was getting difficult to match pans to their lids, or to stack the glassware so it wasn't in danger of shattering when you reached in for the cocktail shaker.</strong></p>
<p>The manner in which I solved this problem was slightly unorthodox, however.</p>
<p>I moved.</p>

<p class="rteleft">You can't get much more organised than empty.</p>
<p class="rteleft">And even better, my new flatmate Ali was kind to unpack in the new flat's kitchen and found homes for everything without danger of breakage. Result!</p>
<p class="rteleft">5.5 down, 4.5 to go.</p>
