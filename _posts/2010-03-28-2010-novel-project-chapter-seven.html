<p><img align="right" width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="165" alt="" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" /><strong>Just in time for the 2-week deadline, here's chapter seven of my 2010 novel!</strong></p>
<p>I was almost expecting that I wouldn't get this one done in time. Luckily, I managed to get past the writer's block thanks to a new tool:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> on the iPhone, a great mind mapping tool I've been using to outline ideas for this chaper. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to do mind-mapping on the go.</p>
<p>Thanks to the folks of Facebook, I've also chosen a name for my protagonist. So the character's name is now (drum roll please) Ben Marsden! I'll have to go back over the next few weeks and add the name to some places where its lacking. Thanks to everyone who made suggestions, and in particular to Linus Lee Bowman, who suggested the final name. Kudos (and beer) to you, Linus!</p>
