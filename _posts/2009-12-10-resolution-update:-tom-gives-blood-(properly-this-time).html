<p><strong>With the end of the year fast approaching, I'm really going to have to put my foot down on ticking off my remaining <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/18">resolutions</a>.</strong> <strong>So tonight I&nbsp;went off for my second bloodletting, and managed to give the full, regulation pint this time!</strong></p>
<p>After my last <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/47">donation experience</a>, I'd managed to let more than half a year pass by without trying again. So this was something of a last shot to tick off the remaining half of this resolution - half meaning actually eking a usable amount of blood out - so suffice to say I was hoping the tube wouldn't kink up again.</p>
<p>Luckily, things went a lot better this time: the vino flowed far more smoothly and I was only beneedled for 5 minutes. Then I headed home with a warm glow of altruism, and an empty right arm.</p>

<p class="rteleft">So I can finally tick off resolution number 8! Guess I'd better start learning an instrument.</p>
