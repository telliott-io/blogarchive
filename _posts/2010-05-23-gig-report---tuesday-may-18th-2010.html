<p><img width="200" height="159" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/n341746814250_8767.jpg" /><strong>After a brief stand up hiatus due to a mild calendar snafu, last Tuesday, I was at&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/event/186767/802460/tnt-comedy"><strong>Tuesday Night at Torriano's</strong></a><strong>, a bi-weekly night in aid of saving the Torriano pub from being redeveloped into flats.</strong></p>
<p>After a couple of less than stellar gigs, this night was exactly what I needed: the room was absolutely packed, with a warm, friendly and receptive audience, and I rekon that every act had a great time.</p>
<p>I was doing my phrasebook routine again, and after my experience at <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/157">Touching Cloth</a>, I had cut down the intro somewhat to get to the gags quicker. This cut out a good chunk of time from the routine, and after a couple of other cuts, this let me start with some tried and tested opening lines. This approach gave me a great confidence boost, and helped me keep my energy up going into the body of the set. I was left with a little more than 5 minutes of material, but when I got the &quot;wrap it up&quot; signal from the compere, I didn't mind cutting out a couple of excess lines.</p>
<p>Granted, listening back to the recording I took, it wasn't my most stellar performance. There were a couple of places where I rushed through lines, so some of the impact might have been lost. But with a little more rehearsal (and less time between gigs), I can sort out these kind of things.</p>
<p>All in all, a fantastic night, and a huge thanks go to Sarma Woolf for organising such a great evening, and to the compere for the night, Don Biswas, who kept the energy up and the pace going so things didn't finish up too late.</p>
<p>Save the Torriano!</p>
