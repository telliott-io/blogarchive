<p><strong>Happy New Year everyone! Continuing my annual tradition of quantifiable goal-setting, here's my list of resolutions for 2011.</strong></p>
<p>Following last year's less than stellar performance, I'm going to focus on stuff I&nbsp;actually want to do, need to do or at least am able to do, rather than choosing things that make amusing headlines. I might even throw in some self improvement for good measure.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here's the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn to juggle</li>
<li>Eat chicken</li>
<li>Eat fish</li>
<li>Write and produce 26 audio/video sketches</li>
<li>Visit a new country</li>
<li>Get the bathroom done</li>
<li>Build something in a bottle</li>
<li>Stop biting my nails</li>
<li>Finish a game of Monopoly</li>
<li>Go skydiving (might actually do it this year)</li>
</ol>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
