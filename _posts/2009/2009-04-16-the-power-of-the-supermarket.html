<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="150" align="right" alt="Yay Consumerism" src="/blogarchive/assets/yayconsumerism.png" />We all know the tricks that supermarkets use to get us to buy stuff - pumping the bakery smells into the air conditioning, putting basic items really far apart, or somehow making a 1% discount seem like a massive saving. And we all know how to protect yourself from their evil machinations: don't go shopping hungry, go to the back first, wear a condom.</p>
<p>But despite all this, I got schooled in consumerism today. I went into the supermarket with a simple goal: buy a can of deodorant and some stamps. Instead, I left with a carrier bag full to bursting point, with such unnecessary items as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Some Mikado</li>
<li>A frozen pizza</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Two cans of deodorant</li>
<li>And <strong>no stamps</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So not only had I been conned into purchasing a full 5 items more than I intended, I also spectacularly failed at purchasing one of the items I specifically planned on getting.</p>
<p>I hang my head in shame, a casualty of the relentless march of consumerism and retail homogeneity. Although on the plus side, the pizza and Mikado (apparently British Pocky) were delicious, and I returned home armed with the knowledge that the checkouts in Sainsbury's don't carry stamps, and some Nectar points.</p>
<p>The man behind me, on the other hand, knew exactly what he was buying: 8 packs of white bread rolls and a bottle of soy sauce. I had to assume he had other things at home, otherwise he'd be making the saddest sandwiches in history. Although they'd probably be quite flavoursome...it was dark soy sauce.</p>
