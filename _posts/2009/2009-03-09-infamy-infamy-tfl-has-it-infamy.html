<p><img width="238" height="300" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/assets/pic334540_md.jpg" />I was running slightly late for work today. Not so late that eyebrows would be raised, but late enough that I would be able to get on the Northern Line at Clapham North without being&nbsp;<strike>asfixy</strike>&nbsp;<strike>asphyxiay</strike>&nbsp;suffocated by a crowd of angry commuters. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>I rounded the corner to the station to see that the shutters were half closed. Not a good sign. Venturing closer in some vain hope that any problems were limited to the Southbound service, I found that the line was suspended up to Stockwell due to <em>&quot;passenger action&quot; </em>- quite the type of action was not explained, be it industrial, affirmative or pump. This was, however, beside the point, in all likelihood it was a fluffy euphimism for the older, decidedly less pleasant term <em>&quot;person under a train&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Fine, I thought, Stockwell's only a short walk north, I can handle that.&nbsp;And was slightly pleased that the train would likely be completely empty. I was half right. After getting mixed up about exactly which platform I should wait on - being in a hurry causing a strange form of temporary dyspraxia - I took a seat on a terminated southbound train that was to be imminently repurposed to go back north.</p>
<p>We sat patiently for a few minutes, smug at attaining seats at this time on a Monday, until the train had a sudden change of heart and decided it was going south after all. So hundreds of eager (read:&nbsp;late) commuters dutifully marched across to the Northbound platform - which, being entirely in tunnels with off-grey tiled walls, seemed a really long way.</p>
<p>The sudden re-repurposing of the train left something of a gap in the service. After five minutes of waiting, an empty Northbound train came into the station, and then went straight back out again without stopping.&nbsp;So we had to wait a further five or so minutes for the next train to arrive (with a running commentary of where it was from the platform staff - who probably shared our ire), this train was invariably rammed, and I was typically stood furthest from the door, so I had to wait for the next train.</p>
<p>Despite there being several of us stood back from the door of a train clearly crowded to Tokyo-ian(?) levels, one woman decided she would still have a try, and stepped around us before poking at gaps in the crowd with her body in a vain attempt to fit inside. Her grim determination might have impressed me, had she not implied by her actions that she thought I was fatter than her - bitch.</p>
<p>The staff announced that they were very sorry for the inconvenience...</p>
