<p>Normally I don't find it too creepy if someone has auto follow turned on for Twitter. In this case, however, I felt somewhat uneasy:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/surveillancestate.PNG" width="602" height="248" /></p>
<p>My plans for political dissidence are now thwarted! The government will now be aware of my every move provided I Tweet about it. My plans for world domination will fall flat on their face as my attempts to raise a secret army through the medium of short form internet messaging draw the attention of whatever the British equivalent of the Secret Service is.</p>
<p>Civil servants across the world will soon pore over the thoughts of an angry nation, noting every unpatriotic sentiment, every badly-spelled howl of protest and every sentence ending in a preposition! And once I have won the battle with myself, I will love Big Brother (but not going so far as to enjoy the Celebrity edition).</p>
