<p><img width="150" height="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/togolonLogo.jpg" />I've got some exciting new updates coming for Togolon, with 1.0.1 fixing some general bugs and tidying things up a little, and 1.1 adding some awesome new features (more on that later). But as the review process is taking a while, I thought I'd make up for it by dropping the price for the full game to a mere fifty nine of the Queen's pence!</p>
<p>So if you haven't picked up your copy yet, what are you waiting for?&nbsp;Boogie on down to the iTunes app store, for 60 levels, its an absolute bargain!</p>
