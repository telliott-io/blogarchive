<p><img alt="Bacon man. He's like Duffman, but for bacon. Oooooh yeah!" src="/assets/baconman2.jpg" width="138" height="252" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" />After seeing Jon Stewart's valiant attempt to give himself a <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=219495&amp;title=bobby-jindals-republican">heart attack in a single mouthful</a>, I was intrigued by this strange and hitherto unknown to me product called Baconnaise. I expected to find a product that mixed bacon fat and mayonnaise in a single entity that would be unthinkable outside of Texas (or possibly Scotland), but what I found was a story of two men's dream. A dream to make everything taste like bacon.</p>
<p>Justin and Dave run <a href="http://www.jdfoods.net">J &amp; D's</a>, producing Bacon Salt, and the aforementioned Baconnaise. These porcine condiments were born from a love of bacon that surpasses even <a href="http://froebe.net/blog/2008/06/19/cali-lewis-does-it-again-she-found-a-new-thing-made-with-bacon-flavor-bacon-floss-droooool/">Cali Lewis'</a>. Their website includes a retelling of their epic rise to be the Ben &amp; Jerry of Bacon, along with recipes, competitions and surprising nutritional information (Baconnaise is actually better for you than mayonnaise, whoda thunk it!).</p>
<p>And we can all be reassured that not only are their Bacon products suitable for vegetarians, they've also been approved as kosher...Waaait a minute!</p>
