<p><img width="300" height="299" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/assets/screenshot(2).jpg" />I'm really rattling off these resolutions! Last week, I finally finished my first foray into iPhone development:&nbsp;<a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/togolon">Togolon</a>!</p>
<p>Given incessant ranting on the blogosphere, I was expecting this process was going to take anything up to a month to complete, but to my surprise, Togolon was approved in a mere 5 days. This left me in a bit of a flap, as I haven't finished the website yet, but still, a nice surprise.</p>
<p>Togolon is an accelerometer-based puzzle game, the aim of which is to &quot;toggle&quot; all the red tiles green before the time runs out. Simple concept, but has been driving my beta testers (read:&nbsp;friends in the pub) mad :-)</p>
<p>Its been a great way to learn the API, too. Nothing like having a project to help you pick up a new skill. Must say I've been consistently impressed with how complete and easy-to-use the tools are.</p>
