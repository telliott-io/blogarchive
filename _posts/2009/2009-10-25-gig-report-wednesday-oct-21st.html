<p>Dale offered to compere this week, so I was doing a spot in the middle of the evening. Perfect place to do it...the room was warmed up, and plenty of time to have a drink afterwards without having enough to induce a hangover the next morning.</p>
<p>I tried tweaking my performance this time, seeing if I could wring a little bit of extra humour from my opener. And it worked pretty well, changing personality completely once I reached the &quot;point&quot; to fool the audience a little. Definitely a tool to use again elsewhere, but sparingly.</p>
<p>The rest of my material went similarly to previous weeks, good start and finish, with a dip in the middle. I'm thinking some of that stuff should be dropped, or otherwise heavily edited. I'm still waffling quite a bit, so I should probably spend some time condensing and heavily rehearsing some segments to get them as tight as I can.</p>
<p>All that said, I'm planning to try something a little different. I'm working on some character stuff for the week after next. After slipping in a couple of the gags this week, I'm looking forward to getting the whole thing in front of an audience.</p>
