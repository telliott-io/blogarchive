<p>I'm finally feeling like I'm getting the hang of this compering malarky. I felt far more comfortable interacting with the audience, and even managed to come up with some off-the-cuff gags riffing on their responses. Granted these gags didn't all work...but one or two went down quite well and that was a nice start.</p>
<p>I also tried out a few little bits of new material. Some hits and some misses, but definitely a few things to try again another night. I'm trying to build up my collection of short gags so I&nbsp;can mix things up a little easier and I have something to fill in small gaps when they come up. And if I can get a few short gags on the same theme, well, there's a routine!</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;guess the lesson I've learned this week is to keep practising as much as I can, and things will gradually come easier. Which is nice to know.</p>
