<p>Nelson was filling in as compere this Wednesday, so I took the opportunity to experiment a little with my spot and try out a character. I'd written a &quot;sensitivity training seminar&quot; as &quot;Ian from Human Resources&quot;. I wasn't sure if the humour would really work, but it went down really well, which was a nice surprise. Even setting up the situation (a corporate getaway) got a laugh, and I got some really good feedback from the other acts.</p>
<p>Doing a character was an interesting departure, and had a different feel to a typical standup set. There was a bit of disconnection with the audience, which I think changed their expectations slightly, and they seemed happier to just watch rather than expecting some kind of interaction. That said, it might not be suitable for every audience, as I learned later in the week.</p>
<p><img width="200" height="104" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/assets/n168910021341_5272.jpg" />Friday was my first attempt at a stand up contest, at the 5th heat of the <a href="http://www.swaggerpromo.com/slapstick-junkie/">Slapstick Junkie</a> competition. This was an interesting one, as the heat was held in the bar area of a restaurant. Suffice to say, this made for a difficult audience. I was up first, and had no idea how to deal with that kind of crowd, and ended up just running through my material with little deviation. I got a few laughs (mainly from shorter &quot;formula&quot; gags), but my more surreal stuff fell completely flat.</p>
<p>The folks that followed me did somewhat better, mostly by acknowledging the room and engaging with the audience, who, while not being great, weren't as hostile as I worried they might be. The more relaxed I can be about chatting with the audience, the better, so I'm going to have another crack at compering next week for practice.</p>
