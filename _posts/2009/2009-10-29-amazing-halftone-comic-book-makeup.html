<p>This morning, I was delighted to find <a href="http://charmedtasha.blogspot.com/2009/10/its-most-wonderul-time-of-year.html">this article</a> by TashaMarie via <a href="http://charmedtasha.blogspot.com/2009/10/its-most-wonderul-time-of-year.html">Laughing Squid</a>. I just cannot get over how awesome this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein-esque</a> makeup job is. Shame there aren't more details, though. Wonder what it was for?</p>

<p>Certainly puts my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3128415&amp;id=222400263">Halloween costume</a> from last year to shame...although I claim moral victory for both not being a professional makeup artist and for applying it myself in a mirror.</p>
