<p><a href="http://www.plinky.com"><img width="480" height="341" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/blogarchive/assets/plinky.PNG" /></a>During my usual work-avoidance feed reading, I came across a link to a gem of a web service, Plinky.</p>
<p>Plinky is a new take on short-form blogging services (like Twitter, Tumblr, etc), but with a twist. Instead of being presented with a totally blank text box - which to many writers is the scariest thing imaginable - you are given a question to help you get those creative juices flowing.</p>
<p>There aren't a huge number of questions at the moment, but they range from the purely fun (&quot;What kind of superhero would you be?&quot;) to the deep and meaningful (&quot;When did you know you were a grown up?&quot;).</p>
<p>Even user profiles have a little twist, asking you to choose from a series of questions that describe you - which offers a little respite from the usual boxes for hobbies, quotes, etc.</p>
<p>At the moment its a bit hard to see if this will take off or will fade into insignificance like so many...fady things. But I found it a nice distraction of a work day (was really quick and easy to get going too), and imagine I'll be answering the odd question here and there. And besides anything else, the interface is so pretty!</p>
<p>Shameless plug time, take a peek at <a href="http://www.plinky.com/people/theothertomelliott">my page</a> on Plinky :-)</p>
