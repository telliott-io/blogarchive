<p><img width="200" height="164" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/n47340762620_8632.jpg" /><strong>A very exciting week at 5 Minutes of Fame this week, not only did we have a TV crew in recording for a programme on Sky One, but it was also my 30th gig!</strong></p>
<p>This week's guest compere was the fantastic Alexandra Clarke, and with more acts than you could shake a stick at, we limited everyone to a strict 5 minutes. So a shorter set for me this week, but that probably helped me trim out some of the clutter, forcing me to pick my best bits and keeping them to time.</p>
<p>Its hard to strike a balance between saying enough in the setup to give the punchline meaning and keeping it short enough to give a good impact, but the cliches are true: less is more. I'm finding I can get rid of a lot of waffle and needless words by rehearsing more and more, so I really need to spend more time running through my bits until I can almost say them on auto pilot (then squeeze out some more humour from the performance rather than just the words).</p>
<p>Of course, the downside of this is that really concise material won't fill as much time, but I can take that as encouragement to write more, and its win-win!</p>
