<p>Some of you may remember my list of <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/18">New Year's Resolutions</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I've crossed one off already, specifically &quot;<em>Get booed off stage at an open mic comedy night</em>&quot;. I was lucky enough to get on the line-up for <a href="http://www.eliseharris.com/ship.html">Ship of Fools</a> in Borough last night. Was nerve-wracking, but a lot of fun, and had a good few friends there for moral support (thanks guys).</p>
<p>Duncan was gracious enough to take a video for me:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zS9aZQeepAM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zS9aZQeepAM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>So....just nine resolutions to go!&nbsp;Woo!</p>
