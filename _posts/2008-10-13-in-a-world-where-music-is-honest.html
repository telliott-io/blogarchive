<p class="rteleft">Quite possibly the weirdest, and yet somehow coolest, music video of all time was A-Ha's <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=RMWXyEHoN88">Take On Me</a> (with the 90s cover version by A1 possibly being the worst video of all time).</p>
<p class="rteleft">As is the case with many awesome videos, it has next to bugger all relation to the song itself (unless &quot;Take on Me&quot; is something you yell when you're coming at a cartoon Norwegian with a pipe wrench). Well, some ingenious soul decided to correct this mistake, and produced a version of the song more homogeneous with the images on screen. Click below for truthly goodness!</p>
<p class="rteleft"><a href="http://current.com/items/89390593_take_on_me_literal_video_version"><img height="410" width="399" border="0" src="/assets/takeonme.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="rteleft">Extra points have to be awarded for the use of the phrase &quot;Pipe Wrench Fight&quot; as backtime, but possibly missed a trick by not mentioning the &quot;Nice Cold, Ice Cold Milk&quot; poster that dates the video even more than the hairstyles (which are apparently still popular in parts of Europe).</p>
