<p>A new billboard has appeared recently on Southwark Street (note I avoided the obvious pun). As I trudged reluctantly to work on Monday, I couldn't help noticing it, not just because it uses an <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=H60&amp;q=sex!+now+that+i%27ve+got+your+attention&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=">advertising gimmick</a> little younger than the oldest profession, but primarily due to its somewhat garish colour scheme:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/P1000221.JPG" width="511" height="697" /></p>
<p>My initial shock - and intense desire to "mark this message as spam" - was quickly replaced by confusion as to how "nasal insertion" could possibly make sex last longer...perhaps the screams of pain would make it difficult to concentrate. There's probably someone kinky enough out there to have tried it. Don't be shy! Anyone? No?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I had to take out my camera and capture this bizarre advert for posterity. Of course I quickly realised that everyone else on the street was assuming I was in need of their services...and didn't have a pen.</p>
