<p><strong>I recently found myself in the exciting position of having to put together some unit tests for a Java command-line utility, whose results of course all went straight to System.out. Handily, Java provides some neat functionality to redirect output streams.</strong></p>
<p>I fiddled around with a few output stream types and hit all sorts of trouble, ranging from pipe streams not being flushed often enough to running out of buffer space to synchronization issues.</p>
<p>Finally, a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/216894/get-an-outputstream-into-a-string">Stackoverflow question</a> on exactly this problem pointed me to an elegant and easy solution that I could just drop in. My snippet is below:<!--more--></p>
<pre>ByteArrayOutputStream pipeOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

// Store the current System.out
PrintStream old_out = System.out;

// Replace redirect output to our stream
System.setOut(new PrintStream(pipeOut));

// Do stuff
// ...
// Done stuff

// Revert back to the old System.out
System.setOut(old_out);

// Write the output to a handy string
String output = new String(pipeOut.toByteArray());</pre>
<p>This is mostly for my own benefit (less Googling if I need to do this again). But heck, if anyone else finds it useful, all the better.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn't want to use this to redirect vast tomes of logging, but for handling a few lines of text output, it's perfect. Add another couple of lines and you get System.err into the bargain.</p>
