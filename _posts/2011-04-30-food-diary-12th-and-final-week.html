<p><strong>Tea's retained it's top spot in spectacular fashion in this final week of food photograph</strong>y.</p>
<p>I've decided to bring this little experiment in public guilt-tripping this week. I have three reasons for stopping now:</p>
<ol>
<li> I've probably got a good idea of my habits by now.</li>
<li> Manually tagging every photo and doing this weekly blog is taking up time I could be doing new, more interesting things.</li>
<li> Next week would be week 13, and I'm superstitious.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->That's not to say it hasn't been worthwhile. I'm drinking more water, started taking my coffee black, finally convinced myself that I don't need <a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/node/214">bread to enjoy soup</a>, and written a funky little bit of JavaScript for making animated histograms from Flickr sets. That last one I might be able to do something more with.</p>
<p>My tea habit's in full force this week, with a shocking 47 cups. That's about 7 a day! But I think this was down to a combination of visiting family for a chunk of the week, and being off work, where at least 3 of those daily cups would have been replaced by black coffee. To put it in electoral terms, the caffeine vote wasn't split as it had been in the past.</p>
<p>But what do I do now? Well, I suppose my aims will be pretty standard: drink more water, drink less alcohol and caffeine and avoid snacking between meals. Given that I lost nearly half a stone with a couple of cheese-free weeks, I should probably steer clear of that where possible as well. Perhaps have a few cheeseless days every week.</p>
<p>I hope this hasn't bored you all to tears with endless photos of hot drinks. Who knows, maybe it's inspired you to think a bit more about what passes your lips. Or even take on a photographic challenge of your own.</p>
<p>Happy eating, drinking and other mandatory life activities!</p>
