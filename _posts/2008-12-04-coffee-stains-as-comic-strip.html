<p>Never failing to provide the best of the weird and wonderful snippets on the web, Boing&nbsp;Boing's RSS feed today brought me a link to a set of <a href="http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/coffee/">illustrations</a> by <a href="http://www.christophniemann.com">Christoph Neimann</a>, an award-winning illustrator with a coffee fixation.</p>
<p>Drawn in coffee on napkins, they depict the artist's lifelong experiences and obsession with a certain popular stimulant-laced beverage.</p>

<p>I'd love to see him release a book of these illustrations, and I'm desperately resisting the urge to refer to this potential product by the common name for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_table_book">boredom allieviating hardback books</a>.</p>
