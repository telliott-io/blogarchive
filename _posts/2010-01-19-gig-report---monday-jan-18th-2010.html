<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="283" align="right" src="/assets/welovecomedyjan18.jpg" alt="" /><strong>I was fortunate enough to have been invited to perform at the first </strong><a href="http://www.welovecomedy.info/"><strong>We Love Comedy</strong></a><strong> of 2010 (run by my good friends Sean Brightman and Renata Muss), and what a great night it was!</strong></p>
<p>The upstairs room at the Blue Posts isn't huge, but that made for a brilliant atmosphere and a really intimate show. The audience was fantastic, really friendly and (mostly)&nbsp;attentive, a joy to perform to.</p>
<p>With Laughing Horse not far off, I was working on my contest set, and took another recording. I had a lot more energy than last week, and only went a little over. There were a few points at which I add-libbed somewhat unnecessarily, and if I&nbsp;can resist the temptation, I can probably get under 5 minutes quite easily. That isn't to say I&nbsp;shouldn't react to anything unexpected, but it would have to be something really obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>I got the feeling that my eyes were roving a little too much, and I was moving from one part of the audience to another too quickly. Eye contact is good, but done badly its probably distracting.&nbsp;I think I'll experiment a little this Wednesday, and try delivering each joke (or at least the ones with clear set up and punch lines) directly to one part of the audience, to really use the rapport built up through eye contact.</p>
<p>Being on quite early, I&nbsp;got to enjoy the majority of the show without any pre-set tension, and it was a fantastic night of comedy!&nbsp;I knew most of the acts fairly well, but they still had me laughing embarassingly loudly. They certainly have the art of the funny delivery down. I&nbsp;have to salute Ian Baker in particular, who I&nbsp;hadn't seen perform in a while, and has got insanely good since. Jammy git.</p>
<p>The headliner, Patrick Monahan, was nothing short of awesome. He made interacting with the crowd seem incredibly easy, coming up with more witty comebacks in 20 minutes than I've written jokes in the last 9 months (I imagine some of them were &quot;stock&quot;, but it made for an impressive performance).&nbsp;I'd like to think that some of these skills come with that level of experience. Definitely someone I'd see again.</p>
<p>So all in all a brilliant night, and one I'd recommend to anyone. Be sure to keep a lookout for the next edition of We Love Comedy!</p>
