<p>Ticked off a third resolution at the weekend, and took the PADI&nbsp;Advanced Open&nbsp;Water course with my local diving club, <a href="http://www.bigsquid.co.uk/">Big Squid</a>. Had a great, but knackering time (three dives a day for two days takes it out of you it seems).</p>
<p>And before anyone says it, here are some pics to show it did happen <img alt="" src="/assets/wink_smile.gif" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="/assets/P1000260.JPG" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter">Was dang cold, so dry suits were mandatory.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="434" alt="" src="/assets/P1000258(1).jpg" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter">Richard and Stephen discovered that&nbsp;&quot;dry&quot; often meant &quot;damp&quot;</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="352" alt="" src="/assets/P1000259.JPG" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter">And that using talc on seals gives you a fetching grey halo. David (foreground) was kind enough to give me a lift on Sunday.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="/assets/P1000261.JPG" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter">But we did all the dives, and after a bit of form-filling, we were sorted.</p>
<p class="rteleft">So now I'm 30% of the way through my aims for the year, and its only March. Might go look at those kitchen cupboards now...</p>
