<p><strong>Interested in seeing me perform stand up?&nbsp;Wow!&nbsp;I'm touched.&nbsp;You sure? Great!&nbsp;Here's where I'll be for the next few weeks. Do pop by, its always nice to have some friendly faces in the crowd. And to have people to talk to in the intervals.</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><em>I've not got anything booked right now, but I'm doing the odd drop-in night here and there. I'll add any pre-planned spots I arrange to this page in due course.</em></p>
<p class="rtecenter">Feel free to let me know if you're popping by on any night, but a surprise visit would be equally nice!</p>
