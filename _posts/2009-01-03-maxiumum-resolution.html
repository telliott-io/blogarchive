<p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" src="/assets/hangover_dog.jpg" alt="The best pictorial representation of a hangover I could find" style="width: 316px; height: 217px;" />The season for merriment is now more or less over: you've emerged from that slightly unreal time between Christmas and New Year, you're dreading the prospect of work on Monday and you finally realised you don't actually have a wheat allergy, but rather ate like a pig for the past week (hence that &quot;bloaty&quot; feeling).</p>
<p>Now my hangover's pretty much worn off - barring a flat outing to the pub last night - I should probably get my act together and do something with this brand spanking new year that lies before me, and trying to put aside the disappointment that its 2009 already and nobody seems any closer to inventing the hoverboard.</p>
<p>At a series of drunken New&nbsp;Year parties (well, two), I&nbsp;started abitrarily making up resolutions. I desperately wanted to avoid the cliches of losing weight, or giving up drinking:&nbsp;the former going reasonably well with my gym routine, and the latter being a complete pipe dream given my complete lack of anything approaching willpower and the fact that most of my social activities culminate in a trip to the pub. This left me making a list of stuff that wouldn't so much make me a better person, but was more things I felt might be a laugh.</p>
<p>So before the last dying gasp of the brain cells that recorded these momentous decisions - unconstitutionally waterboarded in a sea of beer, port and punch with only four ingredients - I&nbsp;figured I should probably write down any information they might still have the capacity to impart upon me. Then perhaps I&nbsp;might be inclined to actually do something about my plans, or some of you might try to hold me to them.</p>
<p>Therefore, here is the list, in no particular order and as much detail as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can muster:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a 10k for charity</li>
<li>Get booed off stage at an open mic comedy night</li>
<li>Finally release the iPhone game I've been working on</li>
<li>Write something on this blog at least once a week</li>
<li>Convince someone to create a Wikipedia entry about me (believe it or not, I'm not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Elliott">the 45 year old Ulster Unionist</a>)</li>
<li>Learn to play an instrument, even if only the Ocarina</li>
<li>Visit at least two countries, and write a review of the local traditional breakfast foods</li>
<li>Give blood</li>
<li>Take the PADI Advanced Open&nbsp;Water course</li>
<li>Organise the kitchen cupboards</li>
</ol>
<p>There we go, my primary goals for the coming year. I'll keep you posted as to whether or not I&nbsp;actually do anything about them. And if anyone feels like helping or joining in on any, feel free to grab me firmly by the left arm at the first given opportunity - or an e-mail would do.</p>
