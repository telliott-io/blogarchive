<p><strong>This has been one heck of a busy year</strong><strong>, tons on at work, buying a flat, decorating said flat, gigging and somehow trying to squeeze in another ten resolutions.</strong></p>
<p>Granted, I've not done quite as well this year as I did in 2009, but darnit, I wasn't anywhere near as busy last year.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a plant alive</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p>This one was a bit touch and go for a while, given that the plant I&nbsp;bought started losing leaves almost immediately after I&nbsp;got it. Desperate attempts to get more light took it from the bedroom to the living room windowsill, then when I moved, temporary accommodations on my desk at work in a private little jungle of displaced plants.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><em>Before</em></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="400" height="535" src="/assets/plantafter.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><em>After</em></p>
<p class="rteleft">Ok, so I've not got around to moving the plants from the office in the six months since I moved into my flat. And my plant isn't looking quite as healthy as in January, but it's still alive so I&nbsp;win!</p>
<p><strong>Go skydiving</strong> - <em>Failed</em></p>
<p>Totally didn't get round to this one. Kept meaning to book it in, but there was always something more urgent to deal with. Still, going to carry it forward to next year!</p>
<p><strong>Write a novel</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="165" align="right" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was the biggest of my challenges for the year, and somewhat dominated the proceedings (just look at the number of blog posts). But it's been one of the more enjoyable tasks I've had, and the final product has come out pleasantly surprising. Had some lovely comments from readers too!</p>
<p>I still think it could be a bit better, so I'm going to spend a little more time next year editing and extending a few bits here and there. Then who knows, I&nbsp;might even sent it to a publisher to get my very own rejection letter to frame!</p>
<p>But why not judge for yourself and download a copy?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/userfiles/Table%20for%2022.pdf">[Current Draft (PDF)]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Buy a round of drinks for a roomful of strangers</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p>This was the first one I completed this year and probably the easiest, although my credit card bill might disagree. But was a nice way to make my <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/137">last night at Five Minutes of Fame</a> just that bit more special.</p>
<p><strong>Have a conversation in a foreign language</strong> - <em>Failed</em></p>
<p>Another one I&nbsp;completely missed out on. Perhaps I should have started by actually learning some words. Or found someone else who spoke Pig Latin.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p>Took some doing to sort this out, but I finally managed it in early December, and it was probably my favourite of my resolutions for the year. I spent a Saturday morning helping decorate a women's refuge in Putney; shifting furniture, giving a wall a lick of paint and some general tidying up.</p>
<p>It was amazing to see just what a difference a few people could make in a morning, and given what the women (and their adorable kids) had probably been through, any little thing to make their stay a bit more comfortable is more than worth doing.</p>
<p><strong>Do 100 push ups</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p>Only just managed this one in time (my arms hurt). Perhaps I should have started the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/index.html">six-week program</a> more than six weeks before the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Beat my time on a 10k run</strong> - <em>Failed (only just)</em></p>
<p class="rteleft">What's <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/180">30 seconds</a> between friends? I may not have quite managed a faster time, but we managed to drag an extra three runners along this year!</p>
<p class="rtecenter">&nbsp;<img src="/assets/P1010222.JPG" style="width: 551px; height: 367px;" alt="" /></p>
<p class="rteleft">Not only that, but I raised a significant amount more money for Epilepsy Research, so I&nbsp;call it a moral victory! Even though I can't really call this one complete.</p>
<p><strong>Climb a mountain</strong> - <em>Complete</em></p>
<p><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="/assets/9 - at the top.JPG" /></p>
<p>Get to the top of a mountain?&nbsp;Check. Have an attack of vertigo?&nbsp;Check. Get involved in a minor car accident?&nbsp;Check.</p>
<p>That was a <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/197">fun week</a>. Probably won't be repeating it in a hurry, though.</p>
<p><strong>Break a world record</strong> - <em>Didn't even bloody try</em></p>
<p>Maybe calling this one a silly nigh-on impossible goal from the start was a bad idea. I&nbsp;didn't even think about how I might do it. What have I learned?&nbsp;Set goals you actually intend to complete, scratch that, intend to try. Darn thing knackered up my average.</p>
<p>So there we go, six out of ten. 60%. A C&nbsp;at best. But I've had a lot of fun and come out with a few achievements I can be pleased with. Maybe next year I'll be a little more realistic with my goals.</p>
<p>Enjoy your New Year's Eve parties and all the best for 2011!</p>
