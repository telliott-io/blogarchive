<p>This year's run may not be part of a <a title="Resolution Update: Tom Runs a 10K (2009)" href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/60">bona-fide resolution</a>, but I'm still going to try and break that 58 minute barrier I <a title="Resolution Update: Beat My Time on a 10K (2010)" href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/180">struggled with in 2010</a>. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>As in previous years, I'll be <a title="Sponsor me at Virgin Money Giving" href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/TomElliott" target="_blank">raising money</a> for <a title="Epilepsy Research UK" href="http://www.epilepsyresearch.org.uk/" target="_blank">Epilepsy Research UK</a>, the only UK charity dedicated to research into the causes, treatment and prevention of Epilepsy - a condition that affects one in 200 people. This is a charity that means a lot to me, as my Mum has suffered from Epilepsy since her teens, and I'm sure that most of you know someone who has been affected by the condition.</p>
<p><!--more-->Even with control of seizures, quality of life for people with epilepsy can be poor. However, new research offers the very real possibility of developing therapies that could transform the lives of those affected. Epilepsy Research UK is a national charity at the forefront of these research developments.</p>
<p>Last year, with your generous support, I raised over £280. Let's see if we can do even better this year!</p>
<p>You can donate quickly and easily at <a title="Sponsor me for the 2011 British London 10K" href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/TomElliott">my Virgin Money Giving page.</a></p>
