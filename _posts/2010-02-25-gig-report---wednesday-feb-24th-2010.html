<p>Strangely, though, watching a recording back, I was reasonably happy with my performance. I didn't stumble over words like I&nbsp;had on Monday, and think I injected a little bit more energy in than previously. I'd snuck a little time to rehearse before I&nbsp;left, which helped immensely.</p>
<p>Despite not really getting many laughs, I seemed to have the audience's attention, and there wasn't any hostility or anything. General feeling was &quot;we like you mate, we're just not finding you particularly funny&quot;. So on the plus side, I didn't feel nearly as bad about the spot as I might have.</p>
<p>I'm not going to beat myself up over it, but think&nbsp;I can take the experience as encouragement to improve. I've got another gig as Ian next Tuesday, so I'm going to spend a good chunk of Sunday working through the set, getting rid of the excess words and perhaps ditching a few of the weaker jokes - the set is ever so slightly over 5 minutes now, so I&nbsp;can afford to cut bits.</p>
<p>I think I'm relying on the clipboard too much as well. I've got the entire set written on it, and although I know most of it without referring to the notes, I&nbsp;still need to follow it to turn pages. I do need the clipboard for a couple of things (holding the &quot;race card&quot;, and a quick-fire list), but if I'm looking to it on and off for the whole thing it might appear unprepared. So I'm going to get rid of everything I&nbsp;don't need and make sure I&nbsp;know the set inside and out.</p>
<p>I'll get it right one of these days...</p>
