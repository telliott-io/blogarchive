<p><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="182" align="right" src="/assets/jesterjesters.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Back at Jester Jesters this week, and with some new short gags in my set. Although I feel I may have gone too far.</strong></p>
<p>I'd reworked my set a little, removing some of the more unreliable gags, and adding in some that I had wanted to try for a while. However, I think I may now have too many puns in the mix. One or two proper groaners in five minutes can be fun, but if every other gag is a horrifically cheesy pun, you might lose the audience a little. No less than three times did I remark on a groan with a variation of &quot;I&nbsp;hate myself&quot;. So much for not commenting after a punchline. That said though, there were some good laughs amongst the groans. If I'm going to do them, I really should be completely unashamed.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep modifying this set, try to get a good mix of different kind of gags in there. Maybe a bit of a running sequence on a single subject, or tying something of a theme together.&nbsp;I know from previous sets I&nbsp;can do links if I spend some time on it. I'm taking some time off over August, and July is looking reasonably quiet gig-wise. I should probably concentrate on writing as much material as I&nbsp;can, then keeping the best bits.</p>
<p>All that said, I&nbsp;enjoyed my spot, and the crowd was warm and friendly as seems usual for Jester's. Not only that, but I&nbsp;saw lots of good friends, even getting to catch up with some folks I&nbsp;hadn't seen in a while. Not the absolute best gig I've ever done, but I've learned some things, and had a great time!</p>
