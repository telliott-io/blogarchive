<p><img width="200" height="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/assets/coffee_morning_jpg(1).jpg" />I'm amazed by the recent surge in research into the effects of coffee on the human brain. First came stories such as this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/caffeine-can-induce-hallucinations-39587"><strong>Caffeine can induce hallucinations</strong></a></p>
<div><em>&quot;Kiwis who imbibe the caffeine equivalent of one and a half cups of espresso coffee &ndash; or seven cups of instant &ndash; are more likely to hallucinate according to a new study, which may explain the ascendant popularity of coffee culture in New Zealand.&quot;</em></div>
<p>followed today by:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/16944/20090115/"><strong>Drinking coffee reduces Alzheimer's risk: study</strong></a></p>
<p><em><span>&quot;Middle-aged people who consume modest amounts of&nbsp;</span></em><a class="nodec" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(204, 102, 0); " href="http://www.thelocal.se/tag/coffee"><em>coffee</em></a><em><span>&nbsp;can significantly lower their risk of developing&nbsp;</span></em><a class="nodec" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(204, 102, 0); " href="http://www.thelocal.se/tag/Alzheimer%27s"><em>Alzheimer's</em></a><em><span>&nbsp;disease, according to a new study by Finnish and Swedish researchers released on Thursday.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p>This may say a lot about the relative attitudes to chemical stimulants in New Zealand as compared to Scandinavians. The Kiwis taking an alarmist approach and Vikings (best synonym I could come up with there, and probably not even the right one) seeking to find a suitable use for what is one of the few legal mind-altering substances in the Western world.</p>
<p>However, taken together I see even more reason that I&nbsp;should cut down my coffee drinking habits. If I continue as I am doing, not only will I&nbsp;have horrifying hallucinations now, but I'm more likely to remember them when I'm an old man.</p>
<p>Cup of tea, anyone?</p>
