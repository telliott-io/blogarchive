<p><img width="150" height="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/togolonLogo.jpg" />I've been overwhelmed by the response to <a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/node/48">Togolon Lite</a>, with a huge number of downloads in just a few days, and some great reviews. So I figured to celebrate, I'd give away some copies of the full game!</p>
<p>The lovely people at <a href="http://www.appgiveaway.com"> www.AppGiveaway.com</a> will give out 10 promo codes to 10 lucky peeps (US iTunes store only, unfortunately), first come, first served, so get there quick! And if you are one of the fortunate 10, I'd really appreciate if you left a review, good or bad, I'm working hard on the next version, so need as much feedback as I can get.</p>

<p>Best of luck!&nbsp;But if you don't manage to get there in time, Togolon is only &pound;1.19 ($1.99) in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307696159&amp;mt=8&amp;s=143441">iTunes App Store</a>, with all 60 levels, and more to come very soon!</p>
