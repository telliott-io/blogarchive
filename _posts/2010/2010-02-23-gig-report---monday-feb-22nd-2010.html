<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="163" align="right" src="/assets/william iv.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Barely two days after my last gig, and I'm dusting off Ian's clipboard again! On Monday night I&nbsp;ventured north to Kensal Green for another gig at the William IV pub, having had so much fun last time I was very keen to return. <br />
</strong></p>
<p>The room seemed a little muted compared to last month, with the &quot;real&quot; audience members a bit quiet and self-conscious. Although the acts were keen to show good support for one another. So a friendly atmosphere, if not quite as warm as last time.</p>
<p>I hadn't run through my set since Saturday, which turned out to be something of a mistake, as I&nbsp;ended up stumbling over a few of my words, and nearly missed out a new gag that I really quite like. Listening back to the recording I took, there were quite a few places where I&nbsp;could have been slicker, and my speech seemed almost broken.</p>
<p>Still, again, none of my gags properly died, and I got a bit of a response for everything. Just need to ramp up the energy and the character's smarm to squeeze everything I&nbsp;can out of the material. I really need to find a way of eking energy from myself, rather than getting it all from the audience - if a crowd is small or quiet, I need to be livening them up. This will be trickier with a character like Ian, who doesn't move a lot, but he's not what you'd typically call &quot;low energy&quot; so I just need to pep it up a bit. And rehearse, really gotta get into a good habit of rehearsing.</p>
