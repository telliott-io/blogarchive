<p><strong><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="210" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/waifh.jpg" />Another crazy week at work, so I'm a tad late in getting this report out. So late, in fact, that it'll be two reports! First up, <em>What Am I&nbsp;Funny Huh?</em>&nbsp;at the Queen's Head, Piccadilly.</strong></p>
<p>Saturday was a tough one, the night being somewhat dominated by a gaggle of young women out on a birthday party - who had a tendency to all start talking at once if you addressed them directly - and the world's most miserable man, commenting on every act to the people next to him, and not really getting involved when an act tried to lure him into a conversation. Still, we soldiered on, and I have to hand it to the acts that managed to get a good reaction and stay in control (one in particular - who's name sadly escapes me - that I'd been chatting to in the break and had commented how worried he was about the situation).</p>
<p>I chose to play it safe, and rattle through my material without giving anyone a chance to chip in, which worked reasonably well from an attention point of view. Unfortunately the sour-faced chap in the third row started a semi-muted conversation early on, and the best comment I&nbsp;could come up with was &quot;are you finished?&quot; which did shut him up, but I got the feeling it turned off the audience somewhat. Before this, I was getting a few muted laughs, afterwards, it was almost as if people were embarassed to. I was put a bit on edge by the whole thing, and think I lost a lot of energy. Its not the first time I've had a hard gig, and won't be the last. I really need to learn not to let these sort of things bother me so much, as it can clearly make a bad gig worse.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I got a lot of nice comments after the gig (even if those comments didn't come along with laughs) so at least I know I'm on the right track, kinda.</p>

<p>Monday, I was back at Jester Jester's, where the crowd was decidedly more friendly, consisting mainly of acts and a few of their friends. I&nbsp;was still a little nervy after Saturday, but once I&nbsp;got that first laugh in the bag, I&nbsp;felt back on form. I'd thrown in my old opener from my &quot;polished&quot; set to have a more solid start, and it payed dividends (although made my set longer than I'd hoped).</p>
<p>As my set went on, I was loosening up more and more, focusing on individuals in the audience for longer, and even getting a decent comeback from an unexpected (although not at all hostile) comment from someone in the front row.&nbsp;There were even points I had to wait for laughter to subside, something I'm more than happy to wait for. And for the first time in a while, I really felt like I&nbsp;was feeding off the audience's energy to put a bit more into my performance. Again, I really need to find a way to add that energy without getting it direct from the audience first, as it made for a much stronger set.</p>
<p>I've been tweaking around with some of the jokes in this set (which I've been calling the &quot;phrasebook&quot; routine), and its begging to feel like its complete. Now I can focus on other aspects, such as emphasis and pacing, rather than trying to identify which gags work and which need replacing.</p>
