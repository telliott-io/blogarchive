<p><strong><img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="207" align="left" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" alt="" />As one of my <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/114">Resolutions for 2010</a> I&nbsp;set myself the goal of writing a novel before the year is out. This is both a sneaky way of keeping me writing fairly regularly, and an attempt to discipline myself into writing about roughly the same thing for an extended period, without being able to justify getting bored and moving on to something else.</strong></p>
<p>Based on a combination of my own experiences and lies so huge as to be unbelievable, the story will follow a twentysomething Londoner through a year's experiences using an online dating service. This structure allows each chapter to follow a single date, handily avoiding any sort of clear plot progression.</p>
<p>Eventually I might think of a title for the thing as well. I briefly considered calling it &quot;An Arbitrary Number of First Dates&quot;, before realising this might get me sued by Adam Sandler. Being sued I&nbsp;can handle, but I just couldn't bear being associated with Adam Sandler.</p>
<p><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>The first draft is pretty much done now, and I've settled on the working title of &quot;Table for 22&quot;. This will no doubt change over time, I take pride in my indecisiveness. Or do I?</p>
<p>I've also consolidate the current draft into a neat little PDF&nbsp;file. The individual blog postings will still link to the original versions of each chapters, but the compiled draft should develop over time, provided I don't get bored and move onto something else. I might even carry on into 2011.</p>
<p>I'll carry on editing chapters l've already posted as time goes on. So hopefully, the finished product will be something approaching bearable to the reader. I might even get some decent similes in eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Current Progress</strong></p>
<p>Word Count: 55,856<br />
% of minimum: 112%</p>
