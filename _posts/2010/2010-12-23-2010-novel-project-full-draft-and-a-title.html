<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="165" align="right" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Now the bulk of the work is done, I've consolidated my novel for the year into a single handy&nbsp;PDF&nbsp;file, and even come up with a title, how organised!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I've also done a bit of editing, corrected names, titled the chapters and such, so the whole thing might even make sense now.</p>
<p>I thought the table of contents looked bare without a title, so I've come up with the working title <em>&quot;Table for 22&quot;</em>, for reasons I won't divulge as they'd probably bore you.</p>
<p>Any and all feedback is welcome. I'm sure there are plenty of typos, mistakes and mysteriously gender-switching restaurant staff to be found.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
