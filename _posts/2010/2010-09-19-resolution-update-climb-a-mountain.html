<p><strong>So I've finally&nbsp;managed to get another resolution ticked off, which is just as well, as the year is quickly drawing to a close! This task saw me heading to the exotic climes of South Wales, to walk up Pen y Fan: the highest peak south of Snowdonia.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>OK, so it wasn't exactly Everest, but give me a break, I'd never gone up a mountain before.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Following Duncan and Ruth's wedding in Cardiff, a few friends had decided to take the opportunity to hope across to Brecon for a walking holiday. Knowing that one of my resolutions this year was to climb a mountain, they kindly invited me along. So nursing moderate (and in one case, severe) hangovers, five of us left Cardiff for a 5 day walking holiday. The group consisted of Martin &amp; Tanya (who'd also been on this year's 10k run), Luke and Steve. Four fairly experienced walkers. And myself, who hadn't been in years.</p>
<p>And what an eventful five days it was! Even before we'd arrived, I'd achieved a personal first. I was involved in my first ever&hellip;car accident!</p>
<p>We took a bit of a wrong turn trying to find the cottage where we were staying and ended up on a dirt track leading up to someone's house. Martin expertly performed a seven-point turn (he says he meant for it to be that many), and we started back to the main road. When all of a sudden, BANG! We veered to the left and found ourselves teetering on the edge of the road above a stream, like something out of the Sweded version of The Italian Job:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="373" align="middle" src="/assets/1 - car in ditch.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Martin's the one on the left, hiding his face in shame. At this point, I was sat in the driver's seat trying to weigh the car down so it didn't go over the edge. Everyone else was behind the camera, uploading pictures to Facebook.</p>
<p>Three shots at getting out later, including wrecking the tow hook on Martin's Micra, we enlisted the services of a guy with a 7.5 ton tow truck. A tow truck that moved more than the car did on the first attempt at pulling it out. It was stuck that bad. Well done, Martin.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="373" src="/assets/2 - being pulled out.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>Still, we got the car out eventually and to a local garage for an assessment, so we could carry on with the holiday. The first day's walking was my first all-day recreational walk since primary school, and was something of a baptism of fire for me. Well, I say fire, it was more like torrential rain.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="375" src="/assets/3 - rainy ridge.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>The day started out quite pleasant, but just after lunch it started drizzling a bit. This turned to light rain as we went uphill&hellip;turning into a pretty continuous pelting of sideways rain and wind that chose to pick up to the standing-up-becomes-hard level on the Beaufort Scale just as we reached the narrowest point of a ridge a lovely sharp drop on one side.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that after a few hours in the rain we were all more than a little damp.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="375" height="500" src="/assets/4 - soaked.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The next day we took it a bit easier, with a bit of a wander by a canal and a visit to Abergavenny Castle. It was threatening rain again, and we didn't want to repeat the previous day's drenching. Especially not wearing plastic bags in still-damp boots.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="373" height="500" alt="" src="/assets/5 - boot bags.jpg" /></p>
<p>The third day was mountain day! We headed up Cribyn first, which left us with a short walk down and back up again to the top of Pen y Fan, our 886m high goal. The view atop Cribyn was pretty impressive.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="375" src="/assets/6 - the view.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>It was at this point, I discovered something interesting about myself. It turns out I suffer from vertigo. This wasn't a problem going up, as I didn't have to look down to see where I was going.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="375" height="500" alt="" src="/assets/7 - down and up.jpg" /></p>
<p>So I find myself On the way down between Cribyn and Pen y Fan Gingerly putting one foot in front of the other in the hope my foothold wouldn't give way below me. So let's just say I arrived at the bottom of the slope a good ten minutes after everyone else. There's something about being passed by pensioners that can rob a guy of his self respect.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, we found that some guy had managed to get a quad bike up there.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="375" src="/assets/8 - got a quad bike up.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>So it couldn't have been that hard to get up. Still, I pushed through and managed it in the end.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="/assets/9 - at the top.JPG" /></p>
<p>So despite the the car accident, the rain and the height-related panic, I managed to climb a mountain! And that's kind of the point of these goals: to experience something once, and then I don't have to do it again.</p>
<p>And as seemed to be the custom in Wales, it started raining again after lunch.</p>
