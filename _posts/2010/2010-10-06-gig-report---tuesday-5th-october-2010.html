<p><img width="150" height="212" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/horatiaComedyBinEflyerWeb.JPG" /><strong>Some people say you need nerves of steel to do stand up. Unfortunately, I have nerves of soft cheese, not unlike a Brie or unbreaded Camembert.</strong></p>
<p>My first spot this week was at Horatia, and a part of the ever-growing Comedy Bin empire. They were a little down on numbers, unfortunately, but strategic placement of seating and pillars meant there was the potential to have a nice, intimate gig...provided you could block out the chatter from the bar (which is an easier skill to learn than you might think).</p>
<p>My first couple of gags went down ok, but I tried to sneak in a new joke early on (being a little short on acts, we had a bit of spare time to experiment), which fell pretty much flat. After that, it was all downhill. My timing collapsed, pace slowed to a crawl and horror of horrors, I completely blanked halfway through. The last point was doubly annoying, given that I hadn't changed the segment in question for a few weeks.</p>
<p>I'm going to take this as a lesson. If its going badly, I need to plough on and try harder, ignoring my crushed little ego like a Conservative government ignores the poor. If I start to lose confidence, the audience will start to think I don't know what I'm doing. I don't, but I'd rather they didn't know that.</p>
<p>Tonight, I'll be working my ass off trying to redeem myself at Touching Cloth. Wish me luck!</p>
