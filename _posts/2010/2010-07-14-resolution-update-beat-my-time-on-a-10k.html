<p><strong>Surprising how quickly a year goes, it doesn't seem all that long ago since last year's </strong><strong>British 10K London Run</strong><strong>, and last weekend, I was doing it all again!</strong></p>
<p>In case you don't remember, <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/60">last year</a>&nbsp;one of my resolutions was to run a 10K for charity. So in July, myself and my friend Tanya took part in a 10K around Central London to support our favourite charities. This year, we both came back to do it again, only this time, we'd managed to con some more friends into joining us. So, at the wonderfully sociable time of 8.15, Tanya, her husband Martin, and our friends Chris and Claire McIver, met up at Embankment station in our finest running gear:</p>

<p class="rteleft">Learning from last year's queueing joy, we did our best to get to the start as quick as we could. We couldn't avoid being caught in a crush of a few thousand people waiting for the start, but on the plus side, we were only caught in the throng for about 20 minutes - rather than an hour or so as last year. Just as well, as it was rather warm out there.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Before we knew it, we were off, and doing our best to dodge our way through the walkers. I got through the first kilometer in about 6 minutes, which was a tad behind schedule. I resolved to pick up the pace a bit, and managed to claw back 30 seconds or so by the 4k mark, when it suddenly became really hard going. Maybe a training regimen consisting entirely of 5k circuits wasn't the smartest plan I've ever come up with.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I kept trying to claw back some time with every passing kilometer marker, slowing a little to grab a couple of bottles of water to counter the heat. These helped cool me down, but also made me feel a tad nauseous. Although thankfully less nauseous than I felt at the end of last year's run.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Keeping an eye on my watch (I'm looking at it on about 20% of the official photos), I made numerous mental calculations as to how quickly I needed to cover the remaining distance. Perhaps I wasn't pushing myself hard enough. I could still subtract.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Finally, the finish line came in sight, 57 minutes and 30 seconds after I'd started. I might still do it! I pulled out as much extra speed as I could muster, which for some strange reason caused me to run in a strange zig-zag pattern potentially doubling the remaining distance. I crossed the finish line, stopping my watch as I passed under the arch, then checked the time.</p>
<p class="rteleft">58 minutes, 29 seconds.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Close, but no cigar. I was left sucking bitterly on the poorly hand-rolled cigarette of not-quite-making-it. On the plus side, I recovered somewhat quicker than last year, and wasn't left doubled-over dry retching.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><strong>We were all decidedly knackered post-run</strong></p>

<p class="rteleft">After catching up with the good folks from <a href="http://www.epilepsyresearch.org.uk/">Epilepsy Research UK</a>, I dashed over to Piccadilly Circus to meet the others and share war stories. Everyone had done much better than they expected (jammy sods), and we were all buzzing with endorphins. Then a few of us went for a well-earned drink. Little tip: two pints on an empty stomach after running 6 miles is a really cheap way to get drunk!</p>
<p class="rteleft">So maybe I didn't actually beat my time from last year, but I wasn't much worse. I'll probably give it another go at an event of my own organisation (meaning I'm probably just going to go for a run on my own) before the year is out. But there was one respect in which I did far better than last time. I've so far raised &pound;280 for Epilepsy Research (not including gift aid)! This is over &pound;100 more than I managed in 2009.</p>
<p class="rteleft">A huge thank you to everyone who's sponsored me and offered me their support. If you didn't get round to it and want to make a donation, it's not too late, just pop along on the link below.</p>
