<p><strong>Ok, its official. I'm lame. Not only am I at least two weeks behind on the next chapter of my novel, but I also completely forgot the 2nd anniversary of this blog!</strong></p>
<p>I've just noticed that as of Sunday I have been keeping this blog for 2 whole years. And what did I do to mark this prestigious occasion? I spent it stripping wallpaper in my new flat. So at least I didn't waste it.</p>
<p>Rest assured I'll be back to regular updates soon, at least once I've got a danged internet connection at home.</p>
<p>I can take solace in the fact that I still have the <a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/node/64">t-shirt I bought</a> for last year's nerdly celebration.</p>
