<p><strong><img hspace="5" height="163" align="right" width="200" vspace="5" src="/assets/william iv.jpg" alt="" />Hot on the heels of my Laughing Horse heat, was a 5 minute spot at the William IV Comedy Night in&nbsp;Kensal Green. A night I&nbsp;can recommend wholeheartedly to stand ups looking for a friendly open mic.</strong></p>
<p>The room at the William IV had a great atmosphere, with loads of comfy chairs to put the crowd at ease. And although the majority of the audience were acts, there was a sense of cameraderie that made for a really friendly crowd. I was on last, which ordinarily would make it harder to enjoy the rest of the show (worrying too much about my own spot), but being in such a friendly room helped put me at ease.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;toyed around with a new opener, which is still in need of some polish. Luckily, I&nbsp;was able to get some laughs from it mainly through the delivery, which shows all the practise is starting to pay off! And once I'd got going, I can honestly say it was one of the best gigs I've had, even thought the audience was small. There's something about having to wait for a laugh to subside before continuing that makes you feel like a comedy demi-God (like Hercules, but with less of the centaur blood poisoning thing).</p>
<p>Being relaxed certainly helped, and gave me the confidence to try out some ad-libbing. Which a fellow act remarked really helped make the act more friendly and accessible. Definitely something to try more often; I&nbsp;should probably aim to trim my sets a little to allow room for it.</p>
<p>All in all, a great sociable night of comedy. Congrats have to go to Fred Barber and Simon Barker for putting it all together!&nbsp;Certainly a night I'd do again.</p>
