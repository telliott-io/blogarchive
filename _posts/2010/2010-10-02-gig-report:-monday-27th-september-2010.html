</strong></p>
<p>Part of the advantage of working from home is getting a good hour before leaving for a gig to run through my set. And rehearsal was certainly necessary for this one, as I was slotting in some new stuff slightly outside my usual style. With the format of Jesters, the crowd usually consists mainly of comedians, so I thought I'd try tailoring some material to their taste: specifically self-referential comedy-about-comedy. Being a bit different to the sort of stuff I&nbsp;usually write (i.e.: not really setup-punchline), I had no idea as to whether or not this would really be funny or not. Turns out it was, thank god!&nbsp;A nice way to mix things up, and nice to know I&nbsp;can tailor things to the crowd, provided I&nbsp;have enough warning...</p>
<p>I also modified my opening a little, trying a lead-in gag about the commonness of my name (given that my namesake recently <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11394708">became leader of the Ulster Unionists</a>) which I was considering trying at another gig this week. This wasn't quite as good as my usual opener, and broke my flow a little for leading into my standard opening gag. Can't win them all. Back to my normal starting gag on Thursday!</p>
