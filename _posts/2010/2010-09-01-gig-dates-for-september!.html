<p><strong><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/standup.jpg" />After a bit of a break over August, I'm getting back on the stand up horse (you have to stand up as there's no saddle) and I've started getting spots booked in for September.</strong></p>
<p>Details of nights I'm gigging, as well as links to the relevant websites are up on my <a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/gigs">Appearances list</a>, why not go take a peek? If you're in the area on any of these dates, you'd be more than welcome to come along. It's always nice to see a friendly face in the crowd.</p>
<p>Here's that link again:&nbsp;<a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/gigs">[Gigs &amp; Appearances]</a></p>
