<p><strong>If you read this blog regularly, you may have guessed, inferred or flat out been told that I've recently moved flat. Having finally got most of the decorating sorted, and everything in its place, I was left with a bit too much stuff, and had to say goodbye to an old friend.</strong></p>
<p>Last weekend, the folks were visiting for some final finishing touches, and I finally got a sofa after two months of sitting on the floor and various items of inflatable furniture with punctures of varying degrees. This meant that my big office chair had to go.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><em>This room ain't big enough for the two of us.</em></p>
<p>I wouldn't have thought myself the sentimental sort when it came to possessions, but I have to admit a little twinge of sadness in throwing this chair out. And to being a little reluctant to eat anything crumbly on my new sofa.</p>
<p>As a little background: I bought the office chair with one of my first paycheques from web site building during the dotcom boom, a simpler time when the sky was the limit, and I was a smug 15 year old who didn't quite know what to do with that kind of money. I procured it for the princely sum of &pound;99, which was worth a bit more a decade ago, but not quite so much that it wasn't a bargain.</p>
<p>The chair provided a comfy and unnecessarily professional and often cramped working area at my parents' house, before following me to my last flat in Battersea and finally to my current place where it served as a makeshift comfy seat in lieu of a couch. Albeit one I couldn't really lie down on properly. So suffice to say, its been something of a fixture of my life for quite some time.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist sitting in it one last time. Nor could I avoid it, as it was the only way I could get it down in the lift.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="652" alt="" src="/blogarchive/assets/2 - riding the lift.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rteleft">So the chair ended its life sat by the bins behind the estate, waiting to be carted away whenever the council sent someone to clear out all the junk left by the surprising number of DIY projects that always seem to be going on in the building.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img width="500" height="380" alt="" src="/blogarchive/assets/3 - you come here often_.JPG" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><em>You come here often?</em></p>
<p class="rteleft">Or at least that's how expected it to end its life. Upon returning to the bins with the remains of a similarly unneeded but not quite as well loved desk, the chair was gone!</p>
<p class="rteleft">I'd like to think it went to a good home, filled with other items of discarded, but still usable furniture. And today it is sitting nestled behind a refurbished mahogany effect desk, covered in pre-chewed pencils and recycled paper. While its new owner reclines on a worn, patched, yet excessively comfy armchair, watching a CRT television using a remote with no&nbsp;battery panel and the numbers worn off.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Saved me putting it on Freecycle.</p>
