<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="164" align="right" src="/blogarchive/assets/n47340762620_8632.jpg" alt="" /><strong>This Wednesday was my final night hosting 5 Minutes of Fame at Rudy's Revenge, and what a night to go out on!</strong></p>
<p>The room was absolutely packed, and the crowd was one of the friendliest I've ever performed to. This was a big help in getting me to relax, and adopt a more conversational style, which worked well for compering the night, and there are elements of this I could inject into my normal sets. However, watching back the video I took, I&nbsp;had a tendency to ramble a little when I hadn't carefully planned what I&nbsp;was going to say. This would screw up the timing of some of my odd little thoughts over the evening. I've been focusing on brevity in my writing a lot, and maybe I need to keep this in mind more when I'm improvising as well.</p>
<p>I'd put together a little &quot;prepared&quot; audience interaction piece, which wasn't brilliant, but was a good start. Definitely something I&nbsp;need to continue with. I&nbsp;had a brief gag about where someone lived (checking they hadn't stolen my wallet) which seemed to work well - although I might need to come up with different gags for different sorts of places. The rest was a little off, but with a bit of time writing, I can probably get a decent minute of banter together. Possibly something to pad out a shorter set. And after a few weeks, it looks like the phrasebook routine will end up being a lot shorter than I originally thought.</p>
<p>Watching my video, I&nbsp;noticed that I still have a habit of glancing down when I'm thinking, and adopting a defensive stance. I really need to cut that out, and be out there the whole time, even when&nbsp;I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing.</p>
<p>All said, it was a great night, and everyone had a good time, acts and audience alike. The quality was really high over the night, including a few folks I&nbsp;hadn't seen before, and look forward to seeing again at other nights. Hats also have to go off to Denis Krasnov for actually telling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats_%28joke%29">the Aristocrats</a> in public. Been waiting a year for someone to do that!</p>
