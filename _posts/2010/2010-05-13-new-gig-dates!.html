<p><strong><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/standup.jpg" />You might have noticed a new link that's appeared in the Menu block: <a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/gigs">Gigs &amp; Appearances</a>. Well, surprisingly enough, this is a list of my upcoming stand up gigs and appearances.</strong></p>
<p>I've just added a heap of new dates to the list, so why not take a peek? If you're in the area on any of these dates, you'd be more than welcome to come along. It's always nice to see a friendly face in the crowd.</p>
<p>Here's that link again:&nbsp;<a href="http://theothertomelliott.com/gigs">[Gigs &amp; Appearances]</a></p>
