<p>Like most people, I&nbsp;hate writing about myself. Sooner or later, I'll spend some hours agonising over what to include, what to leave out, and how to avoid making myself sound like a complete egotistical tool. When that day comes, this page will be full of trivial and hopefully amusing facts about myself - stuff you probably didn't really want or need to know anyway.</p>
<p>Its a bit like writing a personal statement in school.</p>
