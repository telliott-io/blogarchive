<p><strong>A busy week for me. Not one, not two, but three whole gigs!&nbsp;Three changes for me to hone my comedy craft, or crash and burn in a holy trinity of public humiliation. Thankfully (and surprisingly) there was a lot more of the former!</strong></p>
<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="258" align="right" src="/assets/carnivale.jpg" alt="" />First stop was Carnivale on Monday night. The second time I've been here and I daresay I'm keen to book in again.&nbsp;A well run night with a really friendly crowd of regular comics, and plenty of gags about unisex toilets (something of a rarity in your typical London pub).</p>
<p>I was beginning to feel that the Olympic Mascot material was getting a little stale, having lost its topical edge, so I replaced it with a story about drugs I've had on a back burner for ages. I spent a good chunk of Sunday evening honing and re-working the tale, as well as rehearsing and tweaking the run of shorter gags in the opening few minutes. I've also dropped the one about selling hotcakes, as while its a nice clever thought, its proving more charming than funny.</p>
<p>I wanted to focus on keeping the opening few gags punch and firing them off as quick as I&nbsp;can, so there's no dead space.&nbsp;This worked surprisingly well. I may have covered over a few laughs, but the energy kept high, and the laughs seemed to build on each other from punchline to punchline. So I think the tradeoff was well worth it. I even got a nice smattering of laughs for a gag I'd written that afternoon (which I know I probably shouldn't have put in, but I got away with it).</p>
<p>I still looked at the floor a couple of times, but not between every single gag. And far few in the way of rubbish afterthoughts, I didn't have time for them. The only downside to high momentum for the first section was that the story segment lost a lot of the energy, and felt like it was falling flat. But all in all, a great gig to start the week!</p>
<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="163" align="left" src="/assets/william iv.jpg" alt="" /> Second stop, William IV on Tuesday. A bit thin on the ground attendance wise this month, so it became something of a workshop night. Which was fine, as those of us that were there knew each other pretty well.</p>
<p>Having a little wiggle room with regards to time, I&nbsp;had a quick confab with the audience. Which amounted to getting the few (5) non-comics in the room to introduce themselves. This got a couple of chuckles purely through virtue of what they said themselves, which was handy, as I didn't have anything clever to respond with. Hence afterwards I declared this to be a demonstration of why I don't do audience interaction.&nbsp;Still, fun to experiment.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;launched into my short-form gags and managed to keep the momentum up, getting quite a nice reaction. Again, the story fell a little flat, but still kept everyone entertained.</p>
<p>I'm finding that I really need to work hard in a gig to get the most out of these one and two liners. I can't just phone it in every time, which I realise now I was doing before.&nbsp;The great thing is, I'm getting a feeling for exactly where the effort should go.</p>
<p><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="212" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/welovecomedy.jpg" />My third and final gig this week was at We Love Comedy's new Open Mic night in Piccadilly. The night was at the Queen's Head, which has a lot of comedy on over the week, run by a lot of different people, and I've performed there many a time. I&nbsp;can honestly say this was one of the best nights I've had there. Hats of to Sean Brightman for organising and publicising such a brilliant night, and to Al Cowie for some inspired compering...taking audience interaction to its illogical, toe-sucking conclusion.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was up third in a packed line-up, which worried me a little, as I'd had bad experiences at recent open mics going on early. I was even more worried when the second act didn't turn up and I was pulled up 5 minutes early. There was also a chatty couple in the front row (the over-involved, well meaning pseudo-heckler types) which I was a little worried about. But my quick-fire delivery for the first few minutes had the unintended bonus that they didn't get a pause to say anything, so I&nbsp;managed to avoid getting into an unwanted conversation. I noticed over the course of the night that this was working for a lot of other acts as well. Even amongst the ones that engaged them directly, the best ones were controlling the conversation by cutting them off after a sentence (which would seem rude in conversation, but not when you've got the microphone).</p>
<p>Again, I was a bit naughty and threw in a gag I'd written that afternoon. But it went down incredibly well, the first &quot;afterthought&quot; line getting a laugh even before hitting the key word. Definitely keeping that in. Its nice and clean, too.</p>
<p>The story, again, was probably the weakest part of the set, but it has a nice punchline to it (almost a shaggy-dog story), so think I got away with that. Perhaps its just me getting into the mindset of the quick-fire segment and expecting more frequent laughs. Think&nbsp;I might have some better stories up my sleeve, though.</p>
<p>This was an awesome night to end the week on, and a great week overall. I&nbsp;feel I've stepped up a bit, and just need to make sure I work my ass for all my future spots. And record myself, which I'm ashamed to say, I&nbsp;didn't do for any of these three. There's a lot to think about in this comedy lark!</p>
