<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="165" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" /><strong>Beginning to pick up the pace a little, I'm only a week and a half late with chapter seventeen.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to have to get back on track a little over the next few months. I'm tantalisingly close to my minimum word count, but I've got at least two more chapters worth of story in the offing and more editing than I care to think about before the end of the year. But I'll get there in the end!</p>
