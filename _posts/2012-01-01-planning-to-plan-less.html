<p><img src="/assets/new-year1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="178" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /><strong>Happy New Year! Ok, so I admit, I didn't do too well on my resolutions this year. But I did manage to get a whole heap of other stuff done. So it was a moral victory...kinda.</strong></p>
<p>With 365 days in which to complete my <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/220">2011 resolutions</a>, I managed to fulfill exactly (drum roll) two. For those of you playing at home, these were:Â <strong>Get the bathroom done</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/240">Eat fish</a></strong>. Not exactly the most inspiring of achievements.</p>
<p>I could make all sorts of excuses: the bathroom project taking 10 months due to council cock ups and a company going bust, my experiments in nailbiting cures failing for lack of a high resolution camera, or just really, really disliking chicken.</p>
<p>But excuses are counterproductive. I'd rather look back on the stuff I achieved beyond my official list. I joined <a href="http://phoenixspeakers.co.uk/">a Toastmasters club</a> and delivered 7 speech projects, wrote and release an <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/speakeralert">iOS app</a> in a couple of weekends, got a start on two other apps, helped out on a <a href="http://andrewpmsmith.tumblr.com/post/13629802507/short-film-time-for-a-date">short film project</a>, ran<a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/388"> another 10k</a>, did a PADI refresher course and bought matching coathangers.</p>
<p>Setting resolutions over the past 3 years has helped me discover new sides of myself, and made me push to see what I'm really capable of, but I think now I'm ready to think a bit more short term. I've found that a great way to make something happen is simply to tell people you're going to do it. Announce projects early and let peer pressure keep you motivated.</p>
<p>So for 2012, I'm going to try to cram in as many neat things as I can. I won't be setting any resolutions, save one:</p>
<p><strong>Be awesome.</strong></p>
<p>That's my challenge for this year. And yours too.</p>
