<p class="rteleft"><strong>Hope everyone's having a great festive season!&nbsp;I've put together a little video XMas card for you all (with a very special Christmas Poem). Enjoy!</strong></p>

<p class="rteleft"><strong>The Fight Before Christmas</strong></p>
<p class="rteleft">T'was the night before Christmas,<br />
And all through the flat,</p>
<p>Not a creature was stirring,<br />
For the pub we were at,</p>
<p>The pints were stacked up on the table with care,<br />
In fear the last orders bell soon would be there,</p>
<p>A regular nestled passed out on the floor,<br />
While his girlfriend looks out for a cab by the door,</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>
My mates placed their orders, and I, like a snap,<br />
Went off to the bar for more beers from the tap,</p>
<p>When from the pool table arose such a clatter,<br />
We decided to go give the balls a good batter,</p>
<p>Away to the table we flew in a dash,<br />
Popped in a pound and racked up like a flash,</p>
<p>The lamp o'er the table gave the balls a bright glow,<br />
The cue ball as white, as blue-dotted snow,</p>
<p>When what to my wandering eye should appear,<br />
But a pair of cue balls when just one should be here,</p>
<p>With a poorly aimed driver, so lively and quick,<br />
My ball landed straight in the pint of Big Nick,</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles the bruiser he came,<br />
Squared up at the table and called me such names:</p>
<p>&quot;Like, Wanker! and, Mincer! and, Poofter and Dickhead!<br />
And, Tosspot! and Stupid! and, Spaccer and Inbred!</p>
<p>&quot;You lads take it outside&quot;, Bob the landlord did call.<br />
Now bugger off! Bugger off! Bugger off all!&quot;</p>
<p>As I faced down the meathead, I wanted to fly,<br />
But though that diplomacy might be worth a try,</p>
<p>So up to the bar-top I subtly drew,<br />
&quot;Two beers, one for me, one for Nicholas too.&quot;</p>
<p>I soon got an inkling this was a bad move,<br />
From Nick's snarling and growling, he didn't approve,</p>
<p>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
I caught sight of the glass, 'fore it smashed on my crown</p>
<p>So I dropped to the floor, and my head hit Nick's foot,<br />
I discovered right then, he had caps in his boots;</p>
<p>And so still slightly dazed I was flung on his back,<br />
Then he took me outside like a full rubbish sack.</p>
<p>His eyes -- how they twinkled! His leer was obscene!<br />
My mates were like roaches, nowhere to be seen!</p>
<p>Nick shifted his weight and I braced for a blow,<br />
He flipped me straight up then face down in the snow;</p>
<p>The dregs of a pint he still held in his hand,<br />
Which he placed on the ground while I guessed what he planned,</p>
<p>He took off his belt so to give it some welly,<br />
But then down dropped his jeans, unintentionally,</p>
<p>He was all on display, for briefs he had none,<br />
And I laughed when I saw him, t'was below minus one;</p>
<p>The red in his cheeks seemed to settle my dread,<br />
Before a kick to my groin and a knee in the head;</p>
<p>He spoke not a word, as he hurried inside,<br />
And my friends reappeared; after choosing to hide,</p>
<p>They offered a hanky for my bloody nose,<br />
And giving a nod, back off home we did go;</p>
<p>We sprang to the street, gave a taxi a whistle,<br />
And away we all flew like the down of a thistle.</p>
<p>But I heard Nick exclaim, ere we drove out of sight,<br />
&quot;Happy Christmas to all, what a bloody great fight!&quot;</p>
