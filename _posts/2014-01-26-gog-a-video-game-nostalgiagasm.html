<p><strong><a href="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-01-26-at-00.38.49.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1015" alt="GOG Logo" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-01-26-at-00.38.49.png" width="318" height="102" /></a>As any mobile video game developer from the first wave of smartphones can tell you - a small group, but a proud bunch - nostalgia sells. So if you were a PC gamer in the 90s and 2000s, <a href="http://www.gog.com">GOG.com</a> might be right up your alley.</strong></p>
<p>I'll admit, I'm not a big gamer, I'll occasionally get hooked on a story based game here and there, but I'm not the sort to spend hour after hour fragging whiny teenagers or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZLa4AnN5k">trolling frustrated Call of Duty players</a>. But I do get misty-eyed when I think of my childhood days playing wonderfully crafted low-res strategy or point and click games. And luckily, some part of me has managed to ignore all the frustrated hours spent trying to get DOS to actually <strong>run</strong>Â those games (does anyone know what an IRQ setting actually was?).</p>
<p><!--more-->So jaded was I by the tides of shiny new graphics and ever more confusing controllers - who needs progress? - that I was doing most of my gaming via emulator before I even turned 18. Although dubious legality made it increasingly difficult to get hold of the truly memorable titles. But now, that's all changed with the advent of cut price app stores for every title, and sites like <a href="http://www.gog.com">Good Old Games</a> (gog.com).</p>
<p>GOG is a neat little marketplace for older games: you sign up, browse their titles, and buy a licence for a few units of your local currency (should I be using $ on this blog now?). Once you've bought your chosen titles, you can download them from your account. The best part, is that GOG have put some effort into compatibility, wrapping the old games in up to date installer packages and providing all the hooks they need to run on your new OS - so no more spending hours messing with the DOS configuration to get a game running.</p>
<p>The best part is, many of the games listed have been wrapped for OS X, so Mac gamers aren't left out - that said, I've had to set up a Windows VM to run the majority of the games I've bought, so it's worth paying attention to the compatibility icons.</p>
<div>
<div>Titles I've purchased to date include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Syndicate Plus (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Syndicate Wars (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Carmageddon (Win)</li>
<li>Duke Nukem 3D (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 (Win - interestingly, a Mac port is available on the Mac App Store)</li>
<li>Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 (Win)</li>
<li>Rollercoaster Tycoon (Win) - <em>I admit it, I really like building amusement parks</em></li>
<li>Theme Hospital (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Evil Genius (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Blood (Win)</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament (Win)</li>
<li>Fallout (Mac/Win)</li>
<li>Beneath a Steel Sky (Mac/Win)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Unfortunately, a sad fact of nostalgia gaming is that when you see a fond and hazy childhood memory brought into sharp focus, it inevitably will disappoint, and I tend to find myself dipping in and out of games one by one for a little dose of warm fuzzies, then quitting before I even complete a mission. I then marvel at how awesome and clear my retina display looks by comparison.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still, the warm fuzzies are totally worth it.</div>
