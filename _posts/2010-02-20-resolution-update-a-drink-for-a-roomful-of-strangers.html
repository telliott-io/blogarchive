<p class="rteleft"><span>My first completed resolution of 2010! Last Wednesday I was hosting 5 Minutes of Fame at Rudy's Revenge for the last time. So I thought I'd go out with a bang and as a way of saying thanks to everyone that had supported the night over the last few months, I got a round in at the end of the evening.</p>
<p>Ok, so there were a lot of people there who weren't necessarily strangers. But I think there were enough people I didn't know for it to count. </span></p>
