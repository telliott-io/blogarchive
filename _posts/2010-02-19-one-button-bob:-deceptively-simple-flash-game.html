<p class="rteleft"><strong>In an age when your average video game controller has no less than 12 buttons, and games are so complex they still need 3 different control modes (GTA4, I'm looking in your direction), its refreshing to see developers come out with something as simple as a one-button game.</strong></p>
<p class="rteleft">Such a game, <a href="http://www.silvergames.com/game/one-button-bob/">One Button Bob</a> landed in my browser today in all its Flash glory, courtesy of a link from the <a href="http://www.deepfun.com/">Funsmith's</a> blog. The aptly named Bob is controlled by only one button, but exactly what that button does changes from level to level. So you have to puzzle out what the button does and how to use it to get past the obstacles in your path, then you have to make sure you get the timing just right before you can progress. How many clicks will you need?</p>

<p class="rteleft">For such a simple concept, there is a wealth of variety here, and I often found myself itching to get to the next level just to see what Bob would do next time I clicked. The pick-up-and-play simplicity of it all gets you started, the ever-changing gameplay gets you hooked.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Just goes to show how much variety and longevity you can really get out of a relatively simple concept. I'm tempted to use the word elegant. But that might be a little too pretentious.</p>
