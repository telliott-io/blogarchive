<p>After an extremely long hiatus from my <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/category/ios-shooter">Shoot 'Em Up project</a>, I was itching to see what was new in the world of iOS game development. Discovering the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html">SpriteKit API</a>, I just had to give it a try. So I put together a quick version of Asteroids over a few weekends.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/IMG_4043.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1070" src="/assets/IMG_4043.png" alt="SpriteKitAsteroids-1" width="551" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>It's missing a couple of features (no hyperspace or flying saucers), but was a great way to get to grips with the new API. Not only that but I also got an excuse to play withÂ Git's <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">submodules</a> feature, which I'm sure I'll be using a lot more in future.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/theothertomelliott/SpriteKitAsteroids">full source on GitHub</a>, feel free to download and build a copy!</p>
