<p>Well done on getting so many of your resolutions dones so far mate. I have you as having done the following so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Get booed off stage at an open mic comedy night</li>
<li>Finally release the iPhone game I've been working on</li>
<li>Convince someone to create a Wikipedia entry about me (believe it or not, I'm not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Elliott">the 45 year old Ulster Unionist</a>)</li>
<li>Give blood&nbsp;(half done)</li>
<li>Take the PADI Advanced Open&nbsp;Water course</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So halfway through the year you're halfway there, and have only made one of the remaining ones impossible! That's pretty good going.</p>
<p>If you can give me some vital statistics about yourself I reckon I could embellish them enough to fulfill your resolution about the wikipedia entry, but you have to finish giving blood first!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duncan.</p>
