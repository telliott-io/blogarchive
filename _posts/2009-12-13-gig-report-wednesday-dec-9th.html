<p><img align="right" width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="164" src="/assets/n47340762620_8632.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Another outing for Ian from&nbsp;Human Resources this week, so on Tuesday night I carefully ironed and packed my shirt, trousers and hideous tie, completely forgetting to take the right shoes.</strong></p>
<p>So there I am, arriving at Rudy's Revenge wearing smart clothes one step removed from a business suit, and a pair of beat up Sketchers. If the Shawshank&nbsp;Redemption is to be believed, I could have got away with it, but didn't want to take the risk of someone noticing and having a heckle presented to them on a silver platter. So I improvised.</p>
<p>I spent a few minutes over the night coming up with a pretense for being barefoot, even going so far as to concoct a cheesy rhyme to justify it (&quot;rage can't be projected, when your feet aren't protected&quot;). I was later told this was a pretty good cover. Unfortunately, the majority of my act bombed horribly.</p>
<p>There were probably a number of factors at play: the audience didn't really warm to the character (the only real laughs I&nbsp;got were from some very formulaic gags and funny faces), I was a little distracted by the hastily-added cover lines, and I couldn't find a good way of acknowledging the lack of laughter. Ordinarily, any comment on a failed gag gets at least a small positive reaction (when used sparingly), but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to do this without breaking character, especially seeing as the Ian set is ostensibly based at a conference, rather than a comedy club.</p>
<p>A couple of things I&nbsp;can take from the experience:&nbsp;I should rehearse my sets as often as I can, so I&nbsp;can focus on the performance rather than the words. I rekon I&nbsp;could have squeezed a few more laughs out of the set with better timing and by injecting a dash more absurdity into Ian's mannerisms. Secondly, I should come up with some cover lines in case things are going badly - which would have to be tailored to the character and situation. And finally, I&nbsp;should remember my bloody shoes.</p>
