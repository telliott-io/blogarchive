The new version adds support for <a href="http://www.scoreloop.com/">Scoreloop</a>, providing an online leaderboard and allows you to issue and respond to challenges from players the world over. And still for the low price of &pound;0.59 ($0.99)!</strong></p>
<p>Scoreloop gives Togolon players access to an online community of mobile gamers, where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare scores</li>
<li>Challenge players to races on single levels or whole episodes</li>
<li>Publish scores and big wins on Facebook</li>
<li>Make new friends through Buddy Lists</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also like to offer a huge thanks to the beta testers who volunteered to try out this new version of Togolon before it was submitted.</p>
