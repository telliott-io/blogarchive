<p>Moved from London to New York. Thought, heck it's a big city, how different could life be?</p>
<ol>
<li>Cat people - people who love cats, and people who ARE cats</li>
<li>The subway is awesome, and terrible at the same time. The tube was mildly annoying. The subway is convenient, but EVIL</li>
<li>People are angry (the van thing)</li>
<li>People are noisy</li>
<li>You need winter clothes and summer clothes (never owned so many shorts, nor boots for snow)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
