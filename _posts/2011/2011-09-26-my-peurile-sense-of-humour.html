<p><strong><a href="/assets/220px-Ed_balls.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-426" title="220px-Ed_balls" alt="" src="/assets/220px-Ed_balls.jpg" width="220" height="214" /></a>I found myself overwhelmed with a sense of shame this afternoon, after a BBC News piece on the <a title="Ed Balls" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Balls">Shadow Chancellor</a>'s conference speech left me giggling uncontrollably. The tagline it carried reading simply <em>"Balls: These are the darkest times in my lifetime"</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The wonderful double meaning combined with trivialising a hefty display of rhetoric tickled something within me and I began chuckling at near-audible levels while the gym goers around me continued with their cross-training stony faced. Yes, I watch the News at the gym. That is how cool I am.<!--more--></p>
<p>The low humour to which only I seemed susceptible continued with such gems as:</p>
<p><em>Balls: Must admit we made mistakes in government</em></p>
<p><em>Balls: Government economic plan is 'just not working'</em></p>
<p>and with a delicious secondary double-meaning:</p>
<p><em>Balls: Labour's public spending did not cause crisis</em></p>
<p>My cheeks flushed hot with shame as I felt myself compelled to gather photographic evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/photo1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-425" title="photo" alt="" src="/assets/photo1-1024x764.jpg" width="496" height="370" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is this the kind of man I have become? A man with such a lack of wit that I lose all focus when confronted with a politician whose name doubles as an expression of dismay, triples as an expression of defiance, then both quadruples and sextuples as a euphemism for man parts?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quite probably. Although I take solace in the fact, that somewhere in a BBC basement, perhaps recently relocated to Manchester, a pair of journalism interns, possibly former Young Conservatives are doubled over in laugher and clinking their coffee mugs together. Because on their final day with the corporation, they got one past the editor, and won a fiver.</p>
