<p><strong>In case the nonsensical title didn't make it clear, I've not blogged in a while.</strong><strong> For some odd reason, I've been struggling to think of something interesting to write about.</strong><strong> Not that there isn't enough in the news.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, I could write about the current global financial instability and how all eyes are now on <a title="US loses AA credit rating" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14428930" target="_blank">a system very easily confused with battery sizes</a>.</p>
<p>I could pen an article on the Newscorp phone hacking scandal and a guy I met a couple of times who is now going to prison for an <a title="Murdoch pie attacker's sentence cut to four weeks" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8684206/Rupert-Murdoch-pie-attacker-has-sentence-cut-to-four-weeks.html" target="_blank">unfortunate confection deflection</a>.</p>
<p>Or I could express my fears about the implications of a <a title="Polar bear kills British boy in Arctic" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14415592" target="_blank">tragic polar bear attack</a> and it's inevitable hijacking by climate change skeptics.</p>
<p>Instead I'm just going to post a picture of a laser cat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/IMG_2108.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-396" title="IMG_2108" alt="Laser kitty powering up!" src="/assets/IMG_2108-251x300.jpg" width="251" height="300" /></a></p>
