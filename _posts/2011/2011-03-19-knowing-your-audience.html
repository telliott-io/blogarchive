<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/45535721@N05/5541091044/" title="Random Computery Photo by theothertomelliott, on Flickr"><img width="240" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="179" border="0" align="right" src="/assets/5541091044_fe598a4a99_m.jpg" alt="Random Computery Photo" /></a><strong>A funny thing happened to me the other week, that made me think long and hard about who really visits this blog. And slightly longer and harder about the sorts of things I could be writing.</strong></p>
<p>I got an e-mail last Thursday from someone at onlineschools.org, letting me know that this site had been featured in a <a href="http://www.onlineschools.org/online-computer-repair-schools/">list of useful resources for students of computer repair schools</a>.</p>
<p>Let me just give you a minute to re-read that, in case you&rsquo;re a little confused. Computer repair schools. Given some of my recent postings on attempted resolutions, art critiques and food guilt, you&rsquo;d be forgiven for wondering what value my little blog could possibly offer to the field of computer repair.</p>
<p>Given my status as a massive geek, I have been known to fiddle with the odd computer from time to time - or daily, depending on how accurate you want to be. Such are the joys of my day job as a software developer. When I&rsquo;m feeling particularly geeky, I&rsquo;ve sometimes taken to posting articles on solutions for a few of the IT problems I&rsquo;ve faced. Notably, a <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/52">problem with iPhone upgrades</a>, how to <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/78">recover lost podcasts</a> and a rather geeky discourse on <a href="http://www.theothertomelliott.com/node/40">representing booleans</a>.</p>
<p>Rare as these articles are, they&rsquo;re amongst the most viewed pages on this site, and the podcast example is by far the most commented. Looking back over these comments, I was more than a little pleased to be reminded of how useful this had been to people with the same problem.</p>
<p>So what am I going to do with this overdue analysis of my content? Well, I&rsquo;m going to try and write a few more technical articles in future. A few more How Tos, more tales of interesting coding problems, and perhaps the odd review. That&rsquo;s not to say the random ramblings and attempts at humour will stop. But hopefully if I&rsquo;m looking out for techie stuff to write about with a &ldquo;humourous look&rdquo; (their words, not mine), I&rsquo;ll end up writing more.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the unbroken run of food photos was getting dull.</p>
