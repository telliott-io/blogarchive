<p><strong>It's surprisingly difficult to be a nice person. Sometimes, no matter what you do, you just can't avoid being a prick.</strong></p>
<p>I was at the gym the other day, participating in a company-wide "log 30 mins of exercise a day and we'll measure it with an unnecessarily elaborate world map graphic" month.</p>
<p>I would like to consider myself a good gym citizen. I don't hog the machines, I don't leave gum on the cardio theatre screens and most importantly, I wipe my sweat off the cross trainer when I'm done. Usually, I leave my water bottle in the drinks holder while I go get some paper towels, as an indicator that I've just popped off for a minute. God forbid anyone tried to use the machine before I'd cleaned it!<!--more--></p>
<p>On this particular occasion, the signal wasn't entirely clear, and I returned with my cleaning materials to find a woman clambering onto the machine I had pegged for sanitation.</p>
<p>I had two options here. I could leave her to it and about face for the changing rooms. Or I could inform her of her mistake so I could fulfil my gymly duties. I chose the latter.</p>
<p>"Sorry, " I paused, carefully considering my words, before mumbling, "I just have to clean this one."</p>
<p>She huffed "OK", in the manner of someone who didn't think it was, and moved on to the next machine.</p>
<p>I think I might have made the wrong choice here. On the one hand, I could have left her be and I'd be a prick who didn't clean the cross trainer, and more noticably left an empty water bottle on it. I would, however, have been an anonymous prick. In avoiding those faux pas, I'm now the prick who chucked her off the machine of her choice. And worse than that, I'm a prick with a face.</p>
