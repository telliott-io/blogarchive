<p>I<strong>t only took me four months, but I've fulfilled my first resolution of the year by eating fish for the first time since I was 10! Although it might be another 16 years before I try it again.</strong></p>
<p>Those of you that know me will be aware of my strange food preferences, namely my "no fins, no wings" rule. Knowing I'm probably too old to be that fussy, two of my resolutions for 2011 were to eat chicken and fish. And seeing as yesterday was Good Friday, it seemed the perfect time to have a go at something piscine. My choice? The classic British beer-battered cod:</p>

<p class="rteleft"><!--more-->I thought cod might be a nice way of easing me into the world of finned food, being one of the blander fish out there. And just to prove I wasn't cheating, photographic evidence of one of many mouthfuls in funky slideshow form:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><object width="400" height="300"><param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2F45535721%40N05%2Fsets%2F72157626433475897%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2F45535721%40N05%2Fsets%2F72157626433475897%2F&amp;set_id=72157626433475897&amp;jump_to=" /><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2F45535721%40N05%2Fsets%2F72157626433475897%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2F45535721%40N05%2Fsets%2F72157626433475897%2F&amp;set_id=72157626433475897&amp;jump_to=" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p class="rteleft">Unfortunately, I didn't quite manage to eat the whole thing. Although I liked it more than I expected, I can't say I particularly enjoyed the experience. Guess I'll be steering clear of fish for at least a while longer. But heck, the goal was to eat fish and eat fish I did.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Keeping on the theme of food, here's the full round up of week 11. Water very nearly took the prize this week, but tea just beat it to the finish line. Maybe the result would have been different under AV.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Slaps on the wrist are deserved for the excessive combinations of biscuits, cakes and other confection over the week. I should probably decide on whether I want to call sausages in a bread roll a "sausage bap" or a "sausage sandwich". The distinction at the moment seems to be based on whether it is eaten for breakfast or lunch.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Tomorrow being Easter Sunday I'll be able to eat cheese again. Hurrah! Although I really haven't missed it as much as I thought I would. It's been more of an inconvenience, there being a surprising number of simple dishes that feature cheese in one form or another. It will be nice to have cheese back as an option, but hopefully I won't feel the need to eat it quite as often as I used to.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Have a Happy Easter!</p>
