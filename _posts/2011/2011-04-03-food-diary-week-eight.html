<p><strong>Ok, so not the greatest week health wise. But it wins in deliciousness!</strong></p>
<p>Water's been relegated back to third place this week, and I've picked up a new and dangerous habit: a post-lunch mocha. Plus there was a wonderful moment of weakness when I went to visit the folks on Friday night and Mum shared out some of her birthday chocolates.</p>
<p>I have, however, been trying to experiment a little in the kitchen. Taking some tips from the wonderful burger blog, <a href="http://aht.seriouseats.com/">A Hamburger Today</a>, I've been trying making my own burgers, trying different kinds of mustard as I went, sometimes inside the burger, sometimes cooked into one side, etc. Wonderfully tasty, if not entirely healthy.<!--more--><br />
