<p class="rteleft">Interesting week, this week. A combination of the excessive and the virtuous, with the balance tipped towards the former. The odd glass of water between boozy beverages managed to keep the hangover at bay. A couple of salads at lunch made me feel slightly better at the mountain of cheese and crackers I had on Saturday night. And a few gym sessions (not pictured) hopefully counteracted the odd cupcake and chocolate biscuit.</p>
<p class="rteleft">A serious plus to my heightened alcohol consumption and culinary indulgence is being able to discover new places to eat and drink. For the South London types amongst you, I can heartily recommend a couple of the places I visited. First, there's <a href="http://www.thestonhouse.co.uk/home.php">The Stonhouse</a> near Clapham Common, with great service, a hearty chateaubriand for two, cheeseboard on a slate, and an open fire that's left my jacket with a wonderful smoky aroma days later. Secondly, there's L'Auberge in Wandsworth, a delightful little French place with a menu that didn't put a foot wrong, suffice to say the foodies in the group walked away more than satisfied, a few clutching paper bags full of homemade delights.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Goals for next week? More salad, less booze. Seeing as it's Shrove Tuesday next week, I'm thinking I might give up cheese for lent. Factor out the fromage from this week and my consumption habits suddenly don't look quite so bad.</p>
