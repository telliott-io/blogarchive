<p class="rteleft"><strong><img style="float: right; width: 220px; height: 220px; margin: 5px;" src="/assets/Noteree1-small.png" alt="" />Own a Kindle? Interested in trying out a new productivity app? Get in touch! I’m currently looking for a small number of beta testers for a note taking and mind mapping tool called Noteree.</strong></p>
<p class="rteleft"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Thanks for everyone who's volunteered to take part in the Noteree beta. I've now filled all the spaces I had available. If you're interested in keeping up to date on now Noteree's coming along and when it will be released, take a look at the <a href="http://www.noteree.com">dedicated Noteree site</a>.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I've managed to snag myself a place on the Kindle SDK beta programme and I've been hammering away at my first Kindle application over the last few weeks. I've got a nice stable build together, so now I need <strong>you</strong> to help me test it. I wanted to write an app that I'd want to use myself, that would also fit the nature of the platform, and the result of this is a simple little note taking application for writers: Noteree,</p>
<p><strong>What’s Noteree?</strong></p>
<p>Noteree is a Kindle application for generating and keeping ideas. Write simple text notes anywhere and anytime inspiration strikes.</p>
<p>Need a little kick getting that inspiration? Noteree includes a mind mapping tool to help build ideas from the ground up.<!--more--></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img style="width: 230px; height: 279px; margin: 5px;" src="/assets/screen_shot-51853.gif" alt="" /><img style="width: 230px; height: 291px; margin: 5px;" src="/assets/screen_shot-51850.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Free tagging of notes</li>
<li> Search notes by text or tag</li>
<li> Export notes as text</li>
<li> Export Mind Maps to SVG (readable in any web browser or vector graphics application)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there are plans for lots more exciting features in future versions!</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>I’m after some beta testers to try out the current build of Noteree to help weed out any niggling bugs that might be lurking in the code.</p>
<p>Ideal testers would be anyone who has to keep a lot of notes for their work or hobby (writers, comedians, public speakers, etc). You’ll also need to have your own Kindle, any version will do.</p>
<p>If you come across any bugs or confusing behaviours while using Noteree, I’d appreciate a note describing your problem as early as possible. I’ll be using Bugzilla to track issues, so it’ll be nice and quick for you to raise issues.</p>
<p>At the end of the beta period (aiming to finish <strong><em>5th June</em></strong>), you’d also need to send me a short report with your impressions of the app.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for me?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone helping out with testing will get a copy of Noteree (naturally), and a copy of the final version - the top-tier if the release is split.</p>
<p>As an extra thank you, I’ll also send each tester a <strong>£10 Amazon voucher</strong> after their feedback has been received.</p>
<p><strong>How do I sign up?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re interested in taking part, just drop me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:tom.w.elliott@gmail.com">tom.w.elliott@gmail.com</a> with a little about yourself and how you might use an app like Noteree. I'll only be able to issue keys to a few devices, so don't delay!</p>
