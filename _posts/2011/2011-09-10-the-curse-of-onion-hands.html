This is for two reasons. Firstly, I live alone and can't be bothered to cook for one. And secondly, onion hands.</strong></p>
<p>Onion hands, the lingering smell of onions on one's fingertips after cooking. Sometimes even if you haven't cooked onions. It lingers for days, enduring hand washing, scrubbing and ill-advised use of caustic cleaning products without gloves or adequate ventilation.</p>
<p><!--more-->While the smell is unmistakably oniony, it's not the pleasant scent of fried onion, the odour of a nice onion soup, or the complete un-onionness of cheese &amp; onion crisps. Rather it is a harsh, almost sweaty smell. A constant reminder of the leftovers slowly festering in the fridge. A guilt-ridden spectre of the excessive portion of chilli from the night before. A...smelly...thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how people who cook regularly cope. How can a chef tasked with daily onion chopping live with the constant stench on their hands? Permanent onion hands would be a terrible affliction to bear.</p>
<p>And what of their relatives? Do they start avoiding these onion palmed unfortunates? Do faces turn sour when they walk in a room? Do they start becoming known as "the onion guy"?</p>
<p>Then again, they'd probably get used to it. And who honestly goes around smelling their friends' hands?</p>
