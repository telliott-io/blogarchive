<p><img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="165" align="right" src="/assets/novel_pic.jpg" alt="" /><strong>I've finally got my novel into Chapter 11! Not the bankruptcy one, the other one.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This chapter also marks me passing the halfway point in terms of word-count, and before the mid-point of the year. I should probably get the plot progressing, or I'll run out of chapters to tie up those loose ends...I've not even loosened most of them yet!</p>
