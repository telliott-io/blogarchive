<p>I'm working on polishing a 5 minute set for my Laughing Horse Heat on the 23rd, so I videoed my set to review afterwards&nbsp;(certainly a lot more reliable than my memory). The laughs were a little muted, a lot of which I&nbsp;think was down to my energy being a little low.</p>
<p>I went about a minute over time, even though I've previously timed the same material at below 5 minutes.&nbsp;Part of this was down to audience reactions, but watching the video, it seemed like I&nbsp;was wading through the lines. Although on the plus side, I&nbsp;did a lot better with eye contact, which I&nbsp;think helped greatly in building up an audience rapport.</p>
<p>I'm next performing at <a href="http://www.welovecomedy.info/index.html">We Love Comedy</a> on Monday 18th (looks to be a fantastic evening). And if I&nbsp;can keep up the pace and energy, I&nbsp;should have a great spot!</p>
