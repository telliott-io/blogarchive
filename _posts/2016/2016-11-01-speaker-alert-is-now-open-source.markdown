Speaker Alert has always been 100% free, but has been in a private repository for much of it's lifetime. There was absolutely no reason for this, so Speaker Alert is open source as of this morning!

[[Full source on GitHub]](https://github.com/theothertomelliott/Speaker-Alert)

Feel free to take a poke around, contributions are always welcome.

Not only that, but Speaker Alert 2.5.1 was released into the App Store as of yesterday. This release increases the size of the in-speech time display to be better visible across a room. If you choose to have the time display off, you will get a preview of the actual time elapsed when paused.

Happy speaking!
