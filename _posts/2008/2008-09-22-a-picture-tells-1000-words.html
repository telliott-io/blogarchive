<p>After last week's chaos, the mergers and US&nbsp;government handouts (let's just say they offered a chap some cod) prompted a jump in shares. Which was nice surprise.</p>
<p>BBC&nbsp;coverage of the event was, as usual, swift and to the point. With this page:</p>

<p>At first glance, it would seem the man is cheering the lift in the market. But look closer. Look at the expression on his expensively bespectacled face. Nothing, no joy, no happiness, not even a twinge of hunger. He's stretching. He couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Nice use of stock photos there, Beeb.</p>
