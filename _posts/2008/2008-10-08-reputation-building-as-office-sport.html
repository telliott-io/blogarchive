<p>Being a knowledge worker, every so often I find that there is a coworker looming behind me, wanting to pick my brains for some salient piece of info that they rekon I might posess. And its easier to walk over to someone else than do a Google search.</p>
<p>While I like being helpful, sometimes I hate having my flow disrupted (especially if I'm in the middle of watching the&nbsp;Daily Show through the company proxy). So I'm considering various tactics to reduce these interruptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easy way out would be to stop knowing things, but this might have something of a backlash at my next performance evaluation. And while I hate having to actually do things, I quite like money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hope is not lost, cubicle dwellers, there is a solution! Through subtle use of Firefox's tabbed browsing feature, you can plant subtle hints to pesky office inhabitants that you might be slightly unhinged. Think of every unsavoury and yet fascinating topic you can, and browse to a site proudly naming the topic in its title bar...Wikipedia is a goldmine for this. Look up murder techniques, famous assassins, obscure religions focusing on &quot;the other guy&quot;, heavy rock bands with umlaut fetishes, anything that your average Joe would shy away from like a coconut.</p>
<p>You'll end up with something a little like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/officesport.jpg" alt="" style="width: 537px; height: 19px;" /></p>
<p>Be sure to include at least one work-related page...don't want to look like a slacker. After a while, you'll start getting more and more creative:</p>
<p><img height="27" width="543" src="/assets/officesport2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You'll soon have more free time than you know what to do with. Just check you have some friends <em>outside</em> the office first, otherwise life could get very lonely indeed.</p>
