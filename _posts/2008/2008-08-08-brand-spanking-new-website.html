<p>Hello, its Tom here...no, not that one, the <b>other</b> one. After much faffing, procrastinating and generally not getting stuff done (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0749922648/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218284678&sr=8-1">the book's</a> on my wishlist), I've finally got my arse in gear and set myself up a new website.</p>
<p>Someone once told me (or perhaps I read it) that the best way to get better at writing is to write. Being that I'd like to write, and I don't much care about what, I figured I needed an outlet that wasn't restricted by theme, form, or the necessity to be particularly good.</p>
<p>This would also prove a handy publishing outlet for some of my other projects: a few bits of coding and some rudimentary attempts at podcasting. So pop back soon and there might be some handy web apps (such as a neat little photo uploader), links to some funky open-source projects (or at least, funky if you work in IT) and perhaps even a mockumentary about a state school in the midlands. The sky's my oyster and the world's the limit!</p>
<p>Hope to see you again soon, when there will hopefully be a glut of entertaining and amusing things to see. Or failing that, a LOLCat or two.<br />
