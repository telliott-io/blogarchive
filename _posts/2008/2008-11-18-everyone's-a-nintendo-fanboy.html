<p>Haven't posted in a lil while, as I've been on holiday (and completely forgot to set an out-of-office notice, whoops).</p>
<p>To keep things ticking over, here's a wonderful video game related parody of &quot;Wonderful World&quot;. I'm sure the Satchmo would approve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nTRzaG_GbVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed height="344" width="425" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nTRzaG_GbVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p class="rteleft">Amusingly enough, the mid-90s Nintendostalgia continues, with a team of geeks celebrating Obama's win in their own special way:&nbsp;Super Obama World!</p>

<p class="rteleft">Yes, now you can take control of the incoming leader of the free world (I say free, Britain costs extra) and defeat lipstick-wearing pigs against a colourful 16-bit backdrop! What better way to celebrate the President-Elect's technical-savvy and forward-thinking nature, than portraying him in a 15-year-old video game?</p>
<p class="rteleft">Still, could've been worse. I hear if McCain won, they were planning a <a href="http://gawker.com/5066894/sarah-palins-150000-fashion-spree">Palin-themed</a> version of Bejewled.</p>
