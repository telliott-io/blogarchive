I've put in some extra hours to clean up Speaker Alert a bit, and today pushed the button to launch version 2.2.0!

This version tidies up the speech view considerably: removing the status bar, and hiding the play/stop controls when a speech is in progress (just tap the screen to pause and get them back). Now all you'll see are the alert colors and (optionally) the elapsed time.

The menus have also been improved, and you can reach the demo mode directly from the speech listings.

A few crashes here and there have also been fixed, for a smoother, more stable experience.

Happy speaking!
