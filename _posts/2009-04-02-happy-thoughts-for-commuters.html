<p><img width="360" height="480" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/quoteboard.JPG" />There is a disease spreading across the Tube network. But it is a pleasant disease. A disease that you'd be happy to take home to your elderly relatives. It is the disease of positive thinking.</p>
<p>When I moved to Clapham (almost two years ago now, how time flies), my tube station of choice became Clapham North. I could have continued travelling from Fulham Broadway, but that would have involved a really long walk.</p>
<p>Clapham North at the time had two very nice features. Firstly, they played classical music, and secondly, they had a quotes board. Or, more accurately, a service information board repurposed to provide inspiring morsels of thought on a daily basis.</p>
<p>These would vary from a simple suggestion to smile, through literary witticism and on to downright evangelism. Something for everyone.</p>
<p>It has become a feature of the community (albeit one we don't really acknowledge in conversation), a chance for an individual to share a single sentence with thousands of commuters each day. A sentence that really meant something to the marker-holder, and would hopefully brighten up the readers' day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One could be cynical, and say it is just a distraction to make visitors slightly less aggressive. But for a few seconds each day, I would stop at the top of the escalator with a few of my fellow travellers, and we would share a moment, however brief and silent.</p>
<p>Of course, with everyone stopping to read the day's message, there was a bit of a bottleneck. But the Health and Safety mob in their wisdom chose not to remove it outright (contrary to the current popularity of kneejerk reactions), and it was moved a couple of feet to the left.</p>
<p>And the trend seems to be catching on, with Stockwell and Clapham Common stations getting their own quotes boards. The board at Stockwell is pictured on the right - with possibly my favourite quote. Perhaps one day, this will be TFL&nbsp;policy.</p>
<p>So be on the lookout for these pearls of wisdom (second-hand though they may be), and please let me know where else they crop up.</p>
