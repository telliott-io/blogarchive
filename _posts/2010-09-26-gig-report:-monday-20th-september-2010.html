<p><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="182" align="right" src="/assets/jesterjesters.jpg" alt="" /><strong>My second of three visits to Jester Jesters this month, and I'm pleased to say I did a lot better than&nbsp;I did last time. Although I can't say it was my most stellar performance ever.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Again, I might have skimped on the warm up a little for this one, so things didn't flow as much as I might have hoped.&nbsp;Still, I got a good share of the laughs for the night, and got some really nice comments about my material and even (shock!) my delivery. I'm thinking the wide-eyed, intense style may be the one for me!</p>
<p>That said, I thought I'd experiment a little, and opened with a new gag in a different style. Suffice to say, the gag was weak, and a deadpan, slightly awkward delivery didn't help it any. But I think it provided a nice contrast when I launched into my usual high-energy mode (this might be an effect I&nbsp;can experiment with in future).&nbsp;I&nbsp;think some of the audience were even relieved.</p>
