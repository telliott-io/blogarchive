<p>The weekend before last, I went along to the<a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=41459647353&amp;ref=ts"> Rubber Chicken Club</a> and managed to get an open mic spot. Had a great time, the other acts were great and the audience was fantastic, plus they were taking video:&nbsp;</p>
