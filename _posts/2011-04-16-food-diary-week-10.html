<p><strong>A very pie-heavy week, this one. From cheap, home freezable Sainsbury's minced beef pie to the pub classic Steak &amp; Ale pie. Nothing in between. Pretty much just those two varieties.</strong></p>
<p>I was only in the office one day this week, so Black Coffee's dropped right down the charts to number 6. Water's staying steady at 2, but with far lower numbers than last week. And yes, tea holds on to the top spot for the umpteenth week in a row. Visiting family again this week, where you're offered a fresh cup even before you're halfway through the current one. I should resist. But I'm weak.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed some BBQ food cropping up here and there too. Yes, the weather is finally good enough to cook outside, and stubbornly ignore the fact that you're shivering constantly after about 4pm. But still, the First Barbecue of the Year award 2011 goes to Duncan, and a darn good time was had by all!</p>
<p><!--more-->Also of note are the few Mini Twisters that were recommended to me this week (with the warning that it would be obvious if I didn't try any). I'd forgotten about all those childhood lollies and just how good they were. Years of the "adult" ice cream choices (Magnum and Cornetto, basically) left me forgetting the simple pleasures of an impossible-to-eat-without-freezing-your-teeth-off swirl of lime and ice creamy goodness. I might see if I can find some Mint Feasts next week!</p>
<p>The cheese consensus might well have cracked this week, with the inclusion of "Cheese &amp; Onion" crisps. Luckily, these flavours have never gone anywhere near cheese, or for that matter, an onion. So I'm still keeping to it, with one week of cheeseless struggling to go!</p>
