</strong></p>
<p>I'd been putting off booking more gigs for a while, aiming to write some new material but not actually getting around to putting pen to paper. But after a bit of a bad day at work, I&nbsp;seriously needed to get out for an evening, so wandered down to Jester Jesters for a pint and some free entertainment.</p>
<p>I hadn't expected to be early enough to nab a spot, but as it turned out, there was a bit of space on the bill, so my name went down.&nbsp;Then I realised I&nbsp;hadn't actually prepared anything. Determined to try something new (not just rehash old stuff I&nbsp;knew I'd already outgrown), I thought I'd have a shot at winging it. I&nbsp;wouldn't say I&nbsp;was accomplished at spontanaety, but given previous experiences with the cameraderie and friendly reception at Jesters, there couldn't be many better places to practice.</p>
<p>After a brilliant first section, I&nbsp;jotted down a couple of ideas I'd had at the back of my mind, and took a seat for the second segment. With just 4 other acts before me. I can honestly say I've not been that nervous before a spot in a long while, but I've also not enjoyed one so much in almost as long. Knowing I'd be short of stuff, I watched everyone before intently, trying to come up with amusing references to what had been said before. One of them even got a laugh! Far more satisfying than firing off a bunch of random puns. Granted, I did that too, but without pretending they were anything but, which seemed to serve them well.</p>
<p>Overall, I felt that not being slave to a pre-prepared script let me be far more conversational and laid back. It felt a lot more like a friendly chat in the pub (which, fair enough, it was), and I didn't get phased when members of the audience chipped in at random. I&nbsp;lost them a little after inadvertantly slagging off another act - entirely a slip of the tongue - but my self-deprecating response to this, and a quick man-hug, got me leaving on a high. Even if I ended with one of my old one-liners.</p>
<p>So, it turns out I&nbsp;can be spontaneous. That's a surprise. I should do it more often.</p>
