<p><strong><img width="150" height="116" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/wimbledon.jpg" />The summer is officially here: days are as long as they're going to get, we're in the grip of an unprecedented heatwave (unprecedented as in &quot;first one this year&quot;), and people who normally couldn't care less about tennis are watching it avidly just because it happens to be going on in South West London.</strong></p>
<p>It seems as if everything that happens over this fortnight is somehow related to Wimbledon. This morning's headlines were all of the form <em>&quot;Centre court roasts at 41 degrees!&quot;</em>, as if the weather were somehow localised to a patch of grass 78 feet by 27 feet. I guess it is something we can relate to, the headline: <em>&quot;Dave's flat roasts at 41 degrees&quot;</em> probably wouldn't sell quite so many papers, except possibly to Dave's family and friends.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be such a big deal to everyone if there wasn't someone to support avidly in a fury of national pride we would otherwise be denied in a year when there's no international football tournament. And this year, we have a contender who fulfils both the criteria of having a chance of maybe actually winning, and who can be called British so the pubs have something to play on their expensive plasma TVs - although if he loses, he'll be back to being Scottish, so its win-win for us Sassenach.</p>
<p>As with any sport, I've been somewhat excluded from office banter (I was convinced that &quot;Murray Mound&quot; was some kind of innuendo) and after the recent Grand Prix debacle, I was determined to at least have something to say about the tennis. So in between cooking and dealing with household paperwork, I tuned into Murray's fourth-round match...and suddenly realised I had no idea what the score was, nor who was winning. Rather than hop over to wikipedia to quickly learn the rules of the game so I could figure out what the heck was going on, I tried to judge what was going on based solely on the cheering of the crowd. I think Murray won, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>So, my valiant attempt to get &quot;into&quot; a sporting event thwarted, I resigned myself to another week without much to talk about in the office. I eagerly await next week, when banter can return to the latest political scandal, and how fantastic the new Mitchell and Webb series is (it is fabulous, by the way).</p>
