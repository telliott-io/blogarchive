<p>...they start leaving notes.</p>
<p>I was at <a href="http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/">ICU</a> the other day, helping out with some odds and ends (somehow having graduated two years ago isn't keeping me away), and I couldn't help but chuckle when I came across this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="/assets/IMG_0009.JPG" width="500" height="667" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, and indeed everyone else, was left wondering: If you're that drunk, are you really going to read the notice, stop, clamp your hand over your mouth and calmly redirect yourself into a stall?</p>
<p>On the other hand, most drunks love a challenge.</p>
