<p>I was compering again this week, and it got off to a great start, with a little bit of material at the top of the night going down really well. I'm thinking I might keep to doing a small amount of my best stuff at the start and then not do any more material.</p>
<p>However, after a while, it became difficult to keep the audience's attention in between acts, and we had odd people starting to chatter and get up to go to the bar before I could introduce the next act. I guess in situations like that the only thing to do is not leave any sort of a gap, going straight from one act to another without room to slip a piece of paper between them. The trick will be sensing it before its going to happen.</p>
<p>Despite this, the acts all had a great time, and were generally very well received. And I even got one over on a heckler...but in a nice way.</p>
