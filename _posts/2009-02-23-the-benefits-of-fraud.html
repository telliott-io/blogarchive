<p><img alt="Naughty, naughty benefit thieves" width="170" height="127" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" src="/assets/Shashi Bacheta and Jeff Cole.jpg" />I came across a wonderful little news item about&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7905946.stm?lss">benefit fraud</a> today on the BBC&nbsp;site. In a nutshell, a couple managed to con over &pound;50,000 out of the welfare state through a complicated web of lies, subterfuge, and not understanding the meaning of the phrase &quot;keep it on the down low&quot;. This came with the fantastic Daily Mail-esque middle-class bile inducing headline of&nbsp;<em>&quot;Benefit fraud pair's &pound;100k yacht&quot;.</em></p>
<p>My favourite line in the article had to be:</p>
<p><em>His barrister, Francis Jones, said he was in the process of selling the yacht.</em></p>
<p>Which sounds a bit like a teenage shoplifter offering to return the Coldplay CD if the security staff didn't tell his mum. Of course, he technically only had to sell half of it to make back the money. Or perhaps do &pound;50k worth of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/dorset/7782372.stm">charitable work</a>&nbsp;to clear his conscience. Although a more plausible reason for the sale comes later:</p>
