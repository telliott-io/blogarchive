<p><img width="150" height="166" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/therocket.jpg" /><strong>I was at the Rocket in Acton this week, for something of a special gig. First of all, it was my birthday. And also, the second half of the night featured the delightfully eccentric Paul Foot previewing his Edinburgh show.</strong></p>
<p>I was up first, and unfortunately the response seemed a little muted. I could have put this down to the audience not being warmed up, but watching the video I took, my delivery seemed to lack energy and momentum. I paused a lot for laughs that weren't really coming, and looked at the floor a lot. Part of it might have been due to the lighting, which made it hard to make real eye contact with anyone (not really being able to see their eyes). I really shouldn't be letting things like this phase me, possibly a case for trying to gig in new places as much as I can, to get a feel for different environments.</p>
<p>Chatting to another act after the show, the suggestion was made that I should try just powering through my more &quot;punny&quot; gags both to keep the energy up and avoid dead time if a joke doesn't work very well. I've got a few gigs lined up next week, so I'm going to set aside a good chunk of time on Sunday to rehearse some more, concentrating on keeping my energy high, even without reactions to feed on.</p>
<p>After the first half's open spots, Paul Foot previewed his Edinburgh show. I'd seen Mr Foot perform at ICU about 7 years ago, and if anything he was even more anarchic and eccentric than I remember. It was a real eye opener to see the difference between the open mic level and where he was. He had the audience in fits of almost painful laughter for minutes at a time. Definitely something to aspire to...although it'll be a long slog. This was a performance that was excruciatingly funny, but nobody had the faintest idea why. And that was incredibly refreshing.</p>
