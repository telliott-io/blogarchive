<p>Courtesy of the <a href="http://positivesharing.com/2008/12/you-are-great/">Chief Happiness Officer</a>, I saw this beautiful short film today, had me welling up at my desk.</p>
<p>If there's anything that can encourage a positive outlook on life, this is it.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp;Embedding seems to have been disabled, here's a <a href="http://www.spiritualcinemacircle.com/scc/ecs/public/main/validationMovie.html">direct link</a> to the movie.</p>
<p>Just before you go: You guys are great!</p>
