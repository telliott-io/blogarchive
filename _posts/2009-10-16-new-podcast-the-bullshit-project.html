<p><strong><img width="150" height="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/podcast-logo.jpg" />The last couple of Sundays, I've had the honour of being involved in recordings of The Bullshit Project - run by my good friends Dale and Alex of </strong><a href="http://www.101clubcomedy.com"><strong>101 Comedy</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>I got a little sidetracked with posting, so I've got links to not one, but <em>two</em> episodes for you, you lucky, lucky people:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebullshitproject.com/?p=16">Episode 1 - Sex</a></li>
<li><a href="hhttp://thebullshitproject.com/?p=20">Episode 2 - Fun &amp; Games</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Bullshit Project is recorded live to the hard drive at the Queen's Head on Denman Street, London every Sunday. Come along from 7.15pm and offer your anecdotes, opinions and proposals. This Sunday's topic is &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot;.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The podcast has moved to <a href="http://thebullshitproject.com">www.thebullshitproject.com</a>. Be sure to stay tuned!</p>
