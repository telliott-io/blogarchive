</strong></p>
<p>I'm still faffing about with flat decorating, and successfully managed to get exactly no writing done while I was on holiday. But I&nbsp;got there in the end. Very close to the minimum word count now, and the way things are panning out, I think that in 3 or 4 more chapters, I can just about wrap everything up!&nbsp;Then its onto the editing, and I'm told its going to need a lot of that!</p>
