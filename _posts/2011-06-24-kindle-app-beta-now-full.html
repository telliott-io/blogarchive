<p><img style="float: right; width: 220px; height: 220px; margin: 5px;" src="/assets/Noteree1-small.png" alt="" /><strong>Thanks to everyone who's volunteered to take part in the Noteree beta. I've had a fantastic response from all over the world: friends, colleagues and tech enthusiasts. There's also been some brilliant feedback that's helping to make Noteree even better.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the improvements that have come directly from beta comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved tag management</li>
<li>Improved search</li>
<li>More robust autosave</li>
<li>Greater clarity in help text</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus plenty more suggestions I'm still working on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've now filled all the spaces I had available. If you're interested in keeping up to date on now Noteree's coming along and when it will be released, take a look at theÂ <a href="http://www.noteree.com">dedicated Noteree site</a>.</p>
