<p><img align="right" width="150" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="212" alt="" src="/assets/welovecomedy.jpg" /><strong>In a spectacular fit of spontanaety, I dropped into my second unplanned gig of the week on Thursday, at We Love Comedy Open Mic at the Queen's Head.</strong></p>
<p>After a little encouragement (read: prodding on Facebook chat)&nbsp;from Nelson,&nbsp;I&nbsp;popped along to the Queen's Head for some open mic action and catching up with old comedy friends. Once again, my feelings were perfectly balanced between wanting to go on and wanting to just watch, as I'd gone along with absolutely nothing properly prepared. As it happened, there was plenty of space on the list, so I put my name down.</p>
<p>After Jester Jesters on Monday, I was slightly less nervous about basically winging a 5 minute spot, but still a little bit nervy getting onto stage. I went around shaking hands again (making no bones about it being to kill time) and skipped the random puns to talk through some random thoughts I'd had while chatting with colleagues over lunch. I&nbsp;managed not to offend anyone, I managed to get some decent laughs, and most importantly, I really enjoyed the experience. Upon getting the 30 second light, my response was &quot;already?&quot;.</p>
<p>Having great fun with this spontaneous and conversational approach. Perhaps its just the newness of the style, the newness of the material or the friendly, chatty atmosphere of the night (props to Sean for putting on a great night, despite some technical issues), but its definitely a path to go down a bit further. Admittedly, I'm not getting as many laughs as when I did punny short-form material, but the reactions seem far more genuine now, and not expecting them in every pause is liberating, to say the least.</p>
