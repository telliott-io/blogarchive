On Monday, I had the pleasure of representing [Yext](http://www.yext.com) at [iOSoho](http://www.meetup.com/iOSoho/), New York's largest meetup for iOS Engineers.

I spoke on Auto Layout, covering the issues that we'd had at Yext during development of Screens and how we worked around them. Looking at in depth examples for:

* Unsatisfiable constraints
* Ambiguous Layout
* Crashes

I had a fantastic time and would heartily recommend the meetup to any iOS engineer. Thanks to Marc for giving me the opportunity to present, and to Spotify's New York team for hosting the evening. Already looking forward to [next month's event](http://www.meetup.com/iOSoho/events/226315779/), hosted at Vimeo.
