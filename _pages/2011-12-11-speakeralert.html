<p>You get alerts at 4 times during your speech. Green for your minimum time, Amber for when you're coming to the end, Red for when you need to be finishing up and a flashing alert if you really should be off stage.</p>
<p>Just set the times for your speech, hit Start and put your device down in front of you for clear and bright visual alerts, or pop it in your pocket for vibrating alerts.</p>
<p>If you don't want the time distracting you, just turn it off in the iOS Settings pages.</p>
