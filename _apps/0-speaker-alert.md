Speaker Alert helps you keep your speeches, presentations and meetings to time with a tried and tested traffic light signal system as used at Toastmasters meetings. Green indicates that you've achieved your minimum time, amber lets you know you're close to your maximum and red tells you that you've reached your maximum time. Wrap up quick, the screen will soon start flashing to hurry you along!
